ac.uk, 'Library visit from the General Board ', 'CALL FOR PAPERS Special Issue of &NAME Journal of Natural Language Engineering Software Architecture for Language Engineering &NAME : &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME A number of researchers argued in the early and middle &NUM that the field of computational infrastructure , or architecture , for Natural Language Processing , merited an increase in attention . The reasoning was that the increasingly large-scale and technologically significant nature of &NAME science was placing increasing burdens of an engineering nature on &NAME workers seeking robust and practical methods . Over the intervening period a number of significant systems and practices have been developed in what we may call Software Architecture for Language Engineering . Of the most prominent are : * RAGS , Reference Architecture for Generation Systems ( &NAME and &NAME ) * &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) * &NAME , CES , &NAME ( &NAME , Vassar , etc. ) * ATLAS ( &NAME , &NAME ) * &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) * &NAME ( &NAME &NAME ) * ProtE9gE9 ( &NAME ) * GATE , a General Architecture for Text Engineering ( &NAME ) . This special issue represents an opportunity for pracititioners in this area to report their work in a coordinated setting . The value to the community at large will be to get a snapshot of the state-of-the-art in infrastructural work , which may indicate where further take-up of these systems can be of benefit . &CHAR wide range of topics are relevant , from reference architectures to web services , from component repositories to language resource standardisation , from grid-based distribution to comparative studies of different architectures .

Dictionaries and grammars are applied to texts in order to locate morphological , lexical and syntactic patterns , remove ambiguities , and tag simple and compound words . &NAME is used by several research centers to rapidly construct extractors to identify semantic units in large texts , such as Proper names of persons , locations , technical expressions of finance , etc. INTEX can build lemmatized concordances and indices of large texts with respect to all types of &NAME State patterns . &NUM interesting characteristic of INTEX is that the system is open : users can add their own resources use the INTEX programs to build new applications , and add their own programs to modify INTEX . &NAME is now used in over &NUM research centers as a linguistic platform , an information retrieval system , to teach second languages , as a terminological extractor , as well as to teach computational linguistics to students . As in the previous workshops , ( &NUM , &NUM , &NUM , &NUM and &NUM ) , this meeting will be the opportunity for INTEX users to meet and to exchange their experience of development , research or teaching . It will also be the occasion to present the recent developments of INTEX and &NAME .

Most of them were based on shallow natural language processing techniques , but semantics was not really used , due to the unavailability of generic ontologies . During last years , some generic ontologies become available and a lot of research projets tried to take into account semantic aspects to obtain more precise results for &NAME systems . Meanwhile , important efforts concentrate on developping tools for semi- automatic building of domain-specific ontologies , based on &NAME and text- mining techniques . This workshop will provide a forum for discussion between leading names in the field and researchers involved in the development of ontology-based &NAME systems or semi-automatic tools for building ontologies . We would like to invite researchers , master and Ph. &NAME students to submit their original and unpublished work to the workshop .

Due to the interative nature of the applications and the complexity of the objects , spatial databases face some unique challenges compared to more traditional database systems . As part of the &NAME &NAME Library Project , our work addresses some of these challenges , with a focus on efficient access of large spatial datasets at different levels . At the collection level , browsing allows users to visualize the selectivity of multiple queries before evaluating the queries at the database , thereby provides an effcient way to explore the content of a dataset . For spatial browsing , we first identify a set of spatial relations using a simplified itersection model . We then propose &NUM storage-efficient approximation algorithms based the &NAME &NAME . We also extend the &NAME Histogram as a framework for spatial join selectivity estimation . Based on the characteristics of different datasets , different probabilistic models can be plugged into this framework to provide better estimation results . At the object level , we propose a novel approach to accelerate spatial selections and joins with computer graphics hardware . Spatial database operations are typically performed in &NUM steps . In the {em filtering} step , indexes and the minimum bounding rectangles ( &NAME ) of the objects are used to quickly determine a set of candidates objects , and in the {em refinement} step , the actual geometries of the objects are retrieved and compared to the query geometry or each other . Because of the complexity of the computational geometry algorithms involved , the &NAME cost of the refinement step is usually the dominant cost of the operation for complex geometries such as polygons . We propose a novel approach to address this problem using efficient rendering and searching capabilities of modern graphics hardware . This approach does not require expensive pre-processing of the data or changes to existing storage and index structures , and it applies to both intersection and distance predicates . Our experiments with real world datasets show that by combining hardware and software methods , the overall computational cost can be reduced substantially for both spatial selections and joins .

In addition , there has been an increased level of interest in controlled languages , culminating in the series of Workshops on control led language applications . These have given impetus to both monolingual and multilingual guidelines and applications using controlled language , for many different languages . Controlled languages are subsets of natural languages whose grammars an &CHAR dictionaries have been restricted in order to reduce or eliminate both ambiguity and complexity . Traditionally , controlled languages fall into &NUM major categories : those that improve readability for human readers , particularly non-native speakers , and those that improve computational processing of the text . It is often claimed that machine-oriented controlled language should be of particular benefit when it comes to the use of translation tools ( including machine translation , translation memory , multilingual terminology tools etc. ) . &NAME has shown that high quality &NAME systems can be designed for specialized domains ( e.g. METEO ) . However , the area of controlled translation has remained relatively unaddressed . This is rather strange given its undoubted importance .

ac.uk, '&NAME review : CSL017 / &NUM ', 'Was trying to think of something for the &NAME &NAME . The abstract deadline is really soon but the conference is some way off - the paper is n\'t due till next January . Can you have a look at it for me . &NAME In language acquisition a distinction is made between competence , the learner \'s knowledge of language , and performance , the learners actual use of language . A child \'s produced speech does not necessarily reflect all the linguistic knowledge they have acquired . In fact children seem to understand many lexemes and constructs that they do not use themselves ( &CHAR &NAME et &NAME ) . Child grammars based solely on speech production are inadequate representations of the child \'s linguistic competence . Accordingly , clever &NAME experiments have been constructed which attempt to infer the linguistic competence ( i.e. the child \'s internal grammar ) using comprehension tests ( eg. &NAME , &NAME and &NAME amongst many others ) . In this work , a computational approach has been adopted to investigate the discrepancy between language competence and production . &CHAR modeled learner receives input from a corpus of sentences annotated with logical forms . The corpus used , the &NAME corpus , is a longitudinal study of a child \'s natural interactions with her caretakers over a &NUM year period . The modeled learner consists of &NUM modules : a semantics learner and a syntax learner . On receiving an input utterance the semantics learner attempts to learn a mapping between words and meanings , building a lexicon containing the meaning associated with each word sense . This is achieved by analyzing utterance-meaning pairs using cross-situational techniques ( following Siskind &NUM ) . Subsequently , the syntax learning module tries to learn possible syntactic categories for each word sense using , as an initial guide , the semantic predicates associated with the word sense . Hence the learner exploits the idea of semantic bootstrapping in order to learn syntax ( &NAME &NUM ) . &NUM grammars are acquired : &NUM from a corpus of the child-directed utterances and one from a corpus of the child \'s responses . The grammar acquired from the child-directed utterances should be a super-grammar of the child \'s internal grammar and in a perfect speaker-hearer situation they will be equivalent . This grammar is representative of the child \'s competence . The grammar acquired from the child \'s responses is representative of the child \'s production . Since , due to memory lapses or shifts in attention , the child sometimes produces utterances it considers ungrammatical , the modeled learner is designed to deal with noise , converging on the most likely grammar for the utterances produced . By utilizing the perfect speaker-hearer assumption , the &NUM grammars may be compared in the investigation of the discrepancy between production and competence at different times during the acquisition period . In the full paper the results of this investigation are reported . The difference between known vocabulary vs. produced vocabulary are discussed as well as the idea that consistently produced constructs , which can not be attributed to the child \'s internal grammar , give evidence to suggest some properties of a universal grammar .

ac.uk, 'Response to Consultation on &NAME ', 'Hi , I seem to recall that there was a short paper floating about which described the reuters category hierarchy , and that it was n\'t available on line . Do you have a copy of it I could borrow ? I \'ve tagged just over &NUM documents from the corpus - I figured this would be enough to get a good idea of term overlap . I \'m running scripts now that extract the terms from the tagged versions and collects them into &NUM file per category ; but rather than do that for each category I wanted to choose the best subcats of &CHAR and &CHAR to compare , hence my interest in the paper . I \'ve also read some reasonably interesting papers that use quite unusual representations for features : &NUM paper enumerates all possible subtrees in the parses of the training corpus , the other all ( possibly non-contiguous ) subsequences . Both lead to crazy feature vector sizes , but since &NAME are n\'t explicitly concerned with the vector length this is n\'t really a problem . Neither approach is really linguistically motivated though . The best effort I \'ve seen was by &NAME and &NAME who use latent semantic indexing to compute a linear transform of the &NAME kernel , supposedly warping the feature vector space such that semantically related terms get moved together ( another approach is to use wordnet , and the distance in the semantic net between &NUM terms , to compute a similar transform ) .

ac.uk, 'Re : &NAME &NAME meeting ', '&NAME , good . With regards to disk space - since there is no question of getting enough space to &NAME up even every document in the &CHAR * hierarchy ( and it is not even clear that that will be necessary ) , I figured I would ask for a rough 200Mb of disk space . I have plenty of disk space available to me on my own pc which can be accessed remotely by any program running on the lab pcs . I \'ve included below almost exactly the same workplan as the one I submitted before , but with the requirements section updated slightly . Assuming this is ok I \'ll submit it Monday morning first thing . Thanks , &NAME &NAME &NAME &EMAIL Classifying Text Using Linguistic Features NAME : &NAME &NAME &NUM . INTRODUCTION Classification of text documents remains an important application of both &NAME and machine learning techniques . However , current 91state-of-the-art \' approaches adopt a &NAME method of feature identification by constructing the feature vector from some subset of the set of terms present in the candidate document . It is easily argued that this approach carries with it distinct limitations in its ability to truly characterise a piece of text . Further , the underlying classification system used in current schemes typically remains the &NAME &NAME \' Classifier : a simple , high performance classifier that produces good results on many classification tasks . However , the theory of &NAME is underpinned by the assumption that distinct terms in the feature vector are probabilistically independent , clearly an illegal assumption in the 91set of terms \' case . Thus , &NAME perform well almost in spite of themselves . Therefore it is important to study different classification formalisms to break through the performance ceiling which &NAME appear to have . In particular , kernel based classifiers such as Support Vector Machines and Relevance Vector Machines are of considerable interest due to their ability to map non-linearly separable feature spaces onto linearly separable &NUM in which a simple linear classifier may be learnt . This , along with the removal of the term independence criterion , may allow for much more informed , linguistically motivated feature identification and correspondingly significantly increased classification performance . &NUM . AIMS OF THE PROJECT The aim of this project is to investigate the behaviour and performance of kernel based classification methods on text classification . In particular the performance of the &NAME &NAME &NAME , a kernel based method that unlike the Support &NAME &NAME is unrestricted by patents , will be investigated , along with its ability to cope with mixed feature vector representations ( i.e. combinations of terms and higher-level linguistic constructs ) . Achieving this aim will involve the design and implementation of a classifier , the development of a linguistically motivated feature identification technique and the adaptation of the classifier to achieve best performance on a corpus given the feature identification technique . This project will be considered successful if , upon completion , the performance of kernel based classifiers on text classification has been both empirically measured and theoretically motivated , and the benefit of more informed feature identification techniques has been analysed . &NUM . IMPLEMENTATION / APPROACH a. A linguistically motivated feature identification method will be developed , typically making use of a RASP parse of the corpus to identify linguistic features in the text b. &CHAR kernel based classifier will be designed and implemented ( most likely in C++ ) . The main theoretical problem will be the development of a suitable kernel function that maps the feature vector obtained from &CHAR . onto a linearly separable inner-product feature space . c. The performance of the classifier on the &NAME corpus ( a corpus with fine grained topic categories ) will be measured and the classifier adapted to overcome classification problems that arose d. If time permits , the classifier performance will be compared against that of a &NAME &NAME &NAME &NUM . SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS AND DEPENDENCIES The &NAME corpus is required to provide both training and test data for experimentation . Specifically , I intend to focus on the &CHAR * and &CHAR * hierarchies which should provide sufficient test data to establish performance on fine , medium and coarse grained classification problems . In order to provide for substantial run-time space requirements , as well as storage space for processed corpus items , 200Mb of additional disk space is required . &NUM .

However , it does appear that incorrect bracketing is &NUM of RASP \'s major failings . The overall performance RASP achieves in terms of bracketing is the it only manages to correctly bracket ~45\% of the key entities correctly ( and only ~52\% of the entities it tags are correctly bracketed according to the keys ) . &NAME tokenisation is to blame for at least some of the bracketing problems , but certainly not the majority . Other failings include : - confusion between PERSONs and other ENAMEX subcats . Because of my ( RASP ) name -- ) ( &NAME ) PERSON mapping , * lots * of things tend to get tagged PERSON and , although most of these are actually a &NAME &NAME entity , quite a few are LOCATIONs or ORGANIZATIONs . So while precision for ORGANIZATIONs and LOCATIONs is high , recall is very low . For PERSONs recall is very high , but precision is n\'t great . This situation should definitely be improved by augmenting the lexicon with more locative and organization nouns . ( On the whole , RASP handled &NAME Harbor well , since Harbor tended to be tagged &NAME , same for e.g. Navy_NNJ1 . ) If the subcategorization is ignored , both precision and recall are quite high for the ENAMEX subtask i.e. RASP successfully recognises most ENAMEX entities and that they are ENAMEX entities . - misclassification of DATEs . RASP tends to classify these as TIMEs or totally miss them ( e.g. &NUM would be missed since it \'s just tagged num ) . The confusion with TIMEs stems from the fact that the &NAME task definition states that things like Wednesday are DATEs . So although RASP recognises that it \'s a temporal expression from Wednesday \'s &NAME tag , it does n\'t recognise it as a date since the relevant rule in the grammar ... &NAME &NAME / date : N2 [ &NAME TEMP ] -- ) ( N2 [ &NAME &NAME ] ) H0 ... is n\'t applicable and , seemingly , rarely is . - spurious TIMEs . Expression like \' the time before last \' and \' &NUM days later \' are incorrectly tagged as TIMEs since days and time are tagged &NAME and &NAME . But e.g. relative time expressions are n\'t covered by the &NAME task definition . In general , RASP \'s precision for &NAME is not too bad ( &NUM ) but it \'s bad at recognising when something is a TEMPEX ( &NUM recall ) . I need to investigate the NUMEX subtask by looking at a different key file so I \'ll get back to you about that , although I \'d still like a meeting to discuss these ( and any more ) results .

While both platforms promise to be more cost effective than their monolithic predecessors , they suffer from increased failure rates ( as high as one failed processor a day ) due their size and the fact that they are not manufactured by a single entity . At the same time many computational tasks like protein folding and materials science simulations are becoming larger , taking weeks , months or even a year to compute . In short , program runtimes are greatly exceeding the meantime to failure of their platforms . Our work deals with automatic methods for enabling applications to survive hardware faults . We have developed a way of recording program state at the application-level by using a preprocessor to get the program save its own state . Furthermore , we have developed and implemented a distributed coordination protocol that arranges checkpoints from individual processors into a consistent global recovery line . When any processors fail , everybody else can roll back to their most recent checkpoint and resume their computation , with very little work lost .

We will learn if the proposal is accepted within a couple of weeks now . If it is , and if we get reasonable results from our experiment , we will write some software and go ahead with the task . A footnote : The more I look into this &NAME issue , the more I realise why the baseline first sense heuristic method works as well as it does with the current approach to subcat . It \'s because verbs tend to be polysemic in a \'systematic \' manner so that they often share more than just their first senses . I have n\'t yet had the chance to read linguistic literature about this or do experiments to examine the issue more closely , but I noticed this tendency when searching for suitable test verbs for our &NAME experiment . I would n\'t conclude that &NAME is useless , but it \'s useful for a restricted set of \' idiosyncratic \' verbs only : those verbs whose high frequency senses differ from each other in an unsystematic or unpredictable way ( such as \' bear \' , \'strike \' , \' concentrate \' etc. ) .

I invited &NAME &NAME im &NAME here , but regrettably she ca n\'t make it before March . It \'s ok : I just wanted to talk with her , but do n\'t actually need her help . &NAME &NAME \'s group suggested me some effective clustering algorithms which have n\'t been used for clustering subcat distributions before . They gave me free software , so I will start with that .

The resource is quite impressive : their frames indicate semantic roles ( agent , theme , etc. ) and include useful corpus examples where these roles are marked as they occur in different subcat frames . The frames themselves differ from ours e.g. in parameterizing for prepositions . Such fine grained frames match obviously better with &NAME \'s frames , but I would need to change and refine my approach quite a bit to benefit from that level of detail , i.e refine the subcat classification , split &NAME \'s broad classes to fine-grained classes , obtain sense specific back-off stimates and so forth . I \'m afraid there is not enough time to do all that before my contract ends . And the practical problem for RASP is that FrameNet is not free for commercial purposes : \' We try to make the data produced by the project available to those who need it . Our policy is that the data should be provided free of charge for non-commercial , research and educational use . Those who are interested in using our data commercially or for profit will be expected to provide support for the work of the project . If you are interested downloading the FrameNet data , please send an e-mail giving your name , institutional affiliation ( such as university , for-profit company , non-profit research institute , government , etc. ) , and a general description of how you would like to use the data ( e.g. developing a lexicon for machine translation , writing a learners \' dictionary , teaching a course on semantics , etc. ) to &NUM of the following people : * &NAME &CHAR &NAME , Principal Investigator , &EMAIL * &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME Manager &EMAIL \' &SMILEY &NAME proposal &NAME and I have been working on the &NAME &NAME proposal and aim to submit it before &NAME .

In video transmitted over wireless , whole pictures or a few blocks can be lost due to the low bandwidth and high error rates of those types of channels . Picture rebuilding at the receiver is therefore a useful remedy there and in the compression community this is called * Error Concealment * . In standards conversion for the broadcast television industry new frames need to be built for converting from &NUM fps to &NUM or &NUM fps for instance . In film post-production and special effects the task of removing objects from a sequence of frames is a well known activity and is undertaken at the moment by a combination of clever manual picture manipulation tools . An interesting development in &NUM Television and more recently * &NAME * effects , is the problem of viewpoint interpolation . This requires building new pictures from * virtual * camera viewpoints . This talk considers the unification of the solution to these problems under the guise of * Motion Interpolation * . The task is to build a motion field for picture data which does not exist , by interpolating from motion fields in future and past frames . &CHAR &NAME approach utilising spatio-temporal &NAME is used and the talk considers a practical solution to the massive combinatorial problem that typically results . Results from object removal in a video stream are shown . You are currently subscribed to msrclectures as : &EMAIL To unsubscribe send a blank email to &EMAIL ', LEGI

I feel happy with this because I think there is less work involved in designing a kernel method than I had anticipated , since there are several \'ready-made \' kernel functions that may work suitably , whereas I had assumed I had to roll my own . I \'ve finished the script that runs the tokeniser and tagger , and am currently tagging my small corpus right now - it takes a long time but should finish ( hopefully ) by tomorrow morning . I have scripts that can parse the tagged output and give corpus term statistics for specific category codes , and I \'m working on a script that implements some of the ideas in the \' &NAME Corpora \' paper you pointed me to .

I have a ( basic ) skeleton of the report , essentially very broad section headings , and have tried to sketch in some of the detail of a lit . review .

In &NAME &NUM , the relations are \' inferred \' . Seems like a potential segue to attributed relationships and \' who thinks what about whom \' analysis . Regards , &NAME &NAME &NAME Director of Engineering , Core &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , Inc. &NUM &NAME Ave . , &NAME , CA &NUM In text mining , I find it useful to distinguish between these &NUM ways in which text can carry information about real world entities : &NAME &NUM . The information about the entity is present as a natural language utterance in the text , e.g. \'Mrs . &NAME lives in &NAME . \' &NAME &NUM . The textual record is linked to the person , and that link is critical for using the text as a source of information about the real world entity . For instance , Mrs. &NAME in an email to a social newsgroup use various vocabulary , make references to locations , etc. that would lead one to believe that the author of the message lives in &NAME . The distinction is not sharp , and the same piece of text can obviously carry information in both ways . Linguistically perhaps the difference just boils down to resolving the personal pronoun \' &NUM \' using the \'Sender : \' field of the email rather than a name in the text . In practice , however , I find the &NUM to be very different . In particular , &NAME &NUM is much more susceptible to text classification approaches . One assumes the whole document is \' about \' the person to which it is linked , and you classify the person by classifying the document . In &NAME &NUM , however , you have to be much more serious about the &NAME , since perhaps only that single sentence talks about the entity you \'re interested in , and may do some in a way where the linguistic structure makes a lot of difference . Anyway , I \'m trying to think of a good pair of terms to talk about &NAME &NUM vs. &NAME &NUM . \'Declarative \' vs. \' &NAME \' ? \' Third person vs. First person \' ? Any suggestions ?

ac.uk, 'text classif measures ', '&NAME , It occurs to me that it is actually quite important to balance the size of the test sets when gathering results .

This is an issue for the lingspam testset , where there a far more genuine messages than spam in each test set , making the genuine precision artificially higher than the spam precision . Weighting could then be taken into account after the test sets have been balanced . Does this sound reasonable ? &CHAR ', LEGI

ac.uk, '&NAME &NAME TALK CANCELLED . ', 'In my view , there are &NUM unfortunate aspects of the discussion of the &NAME &NAME case , both on this list and elsewhere . The first is that it has become something of a focal point in the discussion of a possible academic boycott against &NAME . But such a boycott can be carried out at varies levels . At present , there is a de facto informal boycott : very few European academics visit &NAME . Then there is the option of a boycott at the institutional level : European institutions ( e.g. grant-giving bodies ) sever links with &NAME academic institutions . Finally , there is the option of a boycott at the personal level : individual academics sever links with academics employed at &NAME universities . The &NAME &NAME case has been used in various statements to implicitly equate an academic boycott with a boycott at the personal level . But this presents a false choice . It is perfectly coherent to be in favour of a boycott at the institutional level and to oppose a boycott at the personal level . The second unfortunate aspect of the discussion about &NAME &NAME is that there is a tendency to confuse support for her right to engage in political action with support for that action . The essence of the right to engage in political action is that such action is granted even if the majority disagree with the opinion expressed . Therefore , it is perfectly coherent to oppose any disciplinary action against &NAME &NAME by &NAME and at the same time to oppose the academic boycott . &NUM rejoinder to this is that &NAME &NAME \'s actions are discriminatory ( or even racist ) in that they are targeted at academics employed at &NAME universities . But academics employed at &NAME universities do not form an ethnic group , do not share a particular sexual orientation , etc. A personal academic boycott would apply , for example , to Americans employed at &NAME universities , but not to &NAME employed at American universities . One may call this discrimination , but only if the meaning of the term is extended beyond what it is commonly understood to mean . To discriminate , in the intended sense , is to make a distinction between people on the basis of irrelevant properties , e.g. turning someone down for a lectureship because she is female . To be affiliated with an &NAME institution may be seen as potentially relevant in the context of possible boycotts against &NAME , quite apart from the question whether such a boycott is justified . Another rejoinder is that an academic boycott at any level is discriminatory , because &NUM has proposed an academic boycott against other countries whose politics are unacceptable ( see &NAME & &NAME \'s letter in yesterday \'s &NAME ) . This comes down to saying that it is discriminatory to try and do something about &NUM evil unless one does something about all evils . Again , this may be called discrimination , but only if the meaning of the term is extended . There are other concepts that have been stretched in this discussion ( human rights , academic freedom , etc. ) . But that is not the point I wanted to make . The point I wanted to make is that we should not let such matters keep us from discussing the heart of the matter , the arguments for and against an academic boycott against &NAME . I therefore do not agree with &NAME &NAME suggestion that academic practice should be completely divorced from politics , no matter what the circumstances , and that an academic boycott is hence something that should not be debated by institutions like the &NAME . I think we all have the intellectual responsibility to debate exactly these issues .

But the lack of citation to other work seems part of a depressing trend , and I think that it is extremely important that authors properly cite previous work . ( comments to authors ) This paper is concerned with updating a language model for broadcast news over time , using daily newswire and newspaper text as updated training data . The main contributions of the paper are a method for interpolating a language model constructed from recent data with pre-exisiting background &NAME , and a method of lexicon extension aimed at reducing the &NAME rate . The presented experiments aim to assess the effects of lexicon extension in terms of &NAME rate , perplexity and speech recognition &NAME . The final result gives a &NUM reduction in perplexity , but a much more modest &NUM reduction in &NAME . This is usually the case for language model improvements . Overall , I think that the paper presents a reasonable approach to the problem . The method is clearly presented and the experiments are interesting , although the experimental results do not give strong support for the method . I think the paper is acceptable for publication given the changes referred to below . The principal drawback with the paper as presented is that the authors do not provude much context to other work , and there a lot of relevant work is not cited . * Language model adaptation , in particular mixture-based methods . &NUM example citations ( there are many others ) : &NAME and &NAME ( &NUM ) . \' On the Dynamic Adaptation of Stochastic Language Models \' . &NAME &NAME and &NAME ( &NUM ) . \' Language Model Adaptation Using Mixtures and an Exponentially Decaying Cache \' , &NAME . * Lexical adaptation over time . The only cited work is the cache model of &NAME and &NAME . However over the past decade there have been some interesting explicit models of word rate , which should be referred to , for example : &NAME and &NAME ( &NUM ) , \' &NAME mixtures \' , Natural Language Engineering , &NUM ( &NUM ) , &NUM . &NAME ( &NUM ) . \'Distribution of content words and phrases in text and language modelling \' , Natural Language Engineering , &NUM ( &NUM ) , &NUM . &NAME and Renals ( &NUM ) . \' Variable word rate n-grams \' , &NAME . &NAME ( &NUM ) . \' Bursty and hierarchical structure in streams \' , Proc . 8th &NAME &NAME . * Methods for &NAME reduction . There have been several papers in this area over the past decade ( eg several recent papers on using &NAME systems lexicon extension / tuning ) , and I think it would be appropriate to refer to some of this work . The paper would benefit if it was possible for a native English speaker to proofread it . &NUM other minor point : on &NAME &NAME seems to be a very high threshold . ', LEGI

ac.uk, '&NAME information ', 'Hi &NAME , I \'m trying to grasp exactly how much information the GRs contain in comparison to the full parse with relation to the &NAME and &NAME anaphora resolution algorithm . My current hypothesis is that nothing would be gained from using the full parse instead of the &NAME ( as far as this algorithm is concerned ) , but I \'d like to have this confirmed ! I \'m not after a conclusion that says that you could recover the full parse tree from the &NAME , which I know is false . Also I guess that this would confirm that my implementation of the &NAME and &NAME algorithm ( at least for &NAME \'s shallow parser ) is correct . This could be done by having an expert on the parser answer the following questions ( this is actually quite a bit of work -- sorry ) : ( I \'ve included an example and my current way of obtaining it out of the GRs . ) For a pronoun &CHAR and an np &CHAR &NUM ) We can find out that &CHAR is in the argument domain of &CHAR equally accurately from the GRs as from the full parse .

He believes that the man is amusing . Current condition : ( ncsubj &NAME &CHAR ... ) ( ncsubj &NAME &CHAR ... ) verb1 verb2 related through &NAME &NUM ) We can find out that &CHAR is in the &NAME domain of &CHAR equally accurately from the GRs . E.g. &NAME \'s portrait of him is interesting . Current condition : ( ncmod poss noun &CHAR ) ( ncmod ! _ noun &CHAR ) &NUM ) Equally accurate to find out that : &CHAR is a determiner of a noun &CHAR , and &CHAR is contained in Q. E.g.

Current condition : find all words which &CHAR is related to for all related words if word occurs in ncmod , cmod , xmod , mod , iobj , xcomp , ccomp related to a preposition then oblique &NUM correspond to the various filters in the &NAME and &NAME algorithm . &NUM correspond to the salience factors .

Although it was devoted to many research topics related to business information systems , &NUM important aspect has not been discussed yet - ontologies . According to the commonly accepted definition , ontology is a formal , explicit specification of a shared conceptualization . &CHAR special session organized within forthcoming &NAME &NUM is to fill this gap . &NAME are developed to provide a machine-processable semantics of information that is exchanged between different agents , both humans and software . They started in the Philosophy , evolved in Artificial Intelligence but nowadays other research communities adopt them very quickly . &NAME face strong expectations , especially in the business area : Knowledge Management and Electronic Commerce . &NAME are heavily exploited by Semantic Web - a vision to link data on the Web in a way that it can be used by machines not just for display purposes , but for automation , integration and reuse of data across various applications . There are a lot of very interesting and promising projects that make use of ontologies . Many different standards emerge . Many groups develop own tools to facilitate use of languages . No one is able to track all activities . Often we are unsure , which proposal will become a standard , which solution is most widely used . It will be advantageous to compare different solutions , proposals , tools , services . The goal of this special session is to share experiences about aforementioned systems , exchange ideas about improvements of existing standards and tools and creation of new systems , principles and applications . Its expected outcome is a common vision about the future directions . This special session is dedicated to groups who contribute to the development of ontologies that can be used in Business Information Systems . We are especially looking for innovative applications taking advantage of the ontologies . Topics of Interest &NAME &NUM invites submissions related to all aspects of the ontologies . Papers MUST clearly demonstrate relevance to the usage of ontologies in Business Information Systems . Suggested topics include but are not limited to : * Business Specific &NAME * &NAME for Data Warehousing , Electronic Commerce , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , etc. * &NAME &NAME E-Business * &NAME for Enterprise Integration * &NAME and &NAME * Economic Models , Financial Justification of &NAME * Semantic Web for Decision Support * Information Access , Searching the Semantic Web * Semantic Web-enabled Web Services * Agent Communication and Applications in the Semantic Web * Visual modeling of &NAME for &NAME * Electronic Trading Systems and &NAME * &NAME &NAME : e.g. &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , &NAME , DAML-S , DAML+OIL * Web Services &NAME &NAME ( description , discovery and interoperation ) * Data / Information / Knowledge Integration by Use of &NAME * Use of &NAME &NAME in &NAME The successful papers should focus on complex solutions rather than technological aspects . Submission Papers to be considered for regular conference presentation and proceedings should be submitted via the regular conference submission process . Detailed instructions , especially formatting , will be published on conference Web page ( see &WEBSITE should be directed to : Dr. &NAME &NAME , &EMAIL . &NAME Research papers Papers should not exceed &NUM words . They should describe original research ( practical or theoretical ) . Theoretical papers should provide an overview of area of research closely related to ontologies in &NAME . Practical papers can describe an implemented tool or service that contributes to the ontologies . &NAME Work in progress Papers should not exceed &NUM words .

net, 'Re : &NAME ', 'In text mining , I find it useful to distinguish between these &NUM ways in which text can carry information about real world entities : &NAME &NUM . The information about the entity is present as a natural language utterance in the text , e.g. \'Mrs . &NAME lives in &NAME . \' &NAME &NUM . The textual record is linked to the person , and that link is critical for using the text as a source of information about the real world entity . For instance , Mrs. &NAME in an email to a social newsgroup use various vocabulary , make references to locations , etc. that would lead one to believe that the author of the message lives in &NAME . The distinction is not sharp , and the same piece of text can obviously carry information in both ways . Linguistically perhaps the difference just boils down to resolving the personal pronoun \' &NUM \' using the \'Sender : \' field of the email rather than a name in the text . In practice , however , I find the &NUM to be very different . In particular , &NAME &NUM is much more susceptible to text classification approaches . One assumes the whole document is \' about \' the person to which it is linked , and you classify the person by classifying the document . In &NAME &NUM , however , you have to be much more serious about the &NAME , since perhaps only that single sentence talks about the entity you \'re interested in , and may do some in a way where the linguistic structure makes a lot of difference . Anyway , I \'m trying to think of a good pair of terms to talk about &NAME &NUM vs. &NAME &NUM . \'Declarative \' vs. \' &NAME \' ? \' Third person vs. First person \' ? Any suggestions ?

edu, 'Re : [ &NAME ] &NAME / recall &NUM point for &NAME &NAME classifier ', 'Hi &NAME ( and ddlbeta ) , Just to clarify , &NAME &NAME does n\'t have to enforce a particular threshold on the probability for classification . It merely characterizes a particular probability model ( conditional independence ) . Once you \'ve computed the probability using &NAME &NAME , the threshold at different levels that &NAME refers to can really be seen as adjusting the loss function used to do the final classification . Since the function you really want to optimize when classifying is the loss , you should make your prediction for the class &CHAR based on the rule : &CHAR argmin {C_pred} [ &NAME ( &CHAR ( &NAME | &CHAR ) * &CHAR ( &NAME , &NAME ) ) ] where &NAME are the possible predictions for the class you could make and &CHAR ( &CHAR , &CHAR ) is the loss incurred by predicting class &CHAR when the truth is class &NAME Under a &NUM / &NUM loss function , you should just predict the class with highest posterior probability , but there are certainly other loss functions you could use that would justify you assigning documents to classes other than the &NUM with raw maximal probability . This just means that you think making some kinds of errors are worse than others ( i.e. , greater loss for particular type of mistakes than others ) . So making the prec / recall curve can just be seen as coming out of adjusting the loss function linearly depending on whether you value precision or recall more in your particular application . Of course , there is a whole separate issue of whether the probabilities that come out of &NAME &NAME are really good estimates for the class probabilities ( which often they are not due to the inherent restrictions of the model ) , and sometimes a non-linear rescaling of these \' probabilities \' is done to try to get values that are more uniformly distributed . That opens another can of worms that you might not want to deal with , though . &NAME that helps , &NAME &NAME Sat , &NAME &NUM , &NUM at &NUM : &NUM : &NAME &NUM , &EMAIL wrote : ', LEGI

Workshop themes The workshop is intended to address what we view as &NUM central issues for the development of computational models of human language processing . We feel these issues represent the current stumbling blocks to constructing the next generation of models , and our aim is to hear concrete views on how to tackle these problems now and where research efforts should be directed in the medium term . &NUM Models of working memory in language processing : to what extent does human working memory influence language processing behaviour , are the mechanisms for language processing adapted to take memory constraints into account ? More generally , how should theories of sentence processing be situated within , and reconciled with , more general accounts of cognitive processing and cognitive limitations ? &NUM . Broad coverage : how can we develop psycholinguistic models that scale up in such a way that explains both high performance in general as well as the more pathological behaviours focused upon in psycholinguistic research ? What kinds of mechanisms ( statistical , constraint-based , ... ) and linguistic theories ( dependency , generative , incremental ) seem most promising for developing broad coverage models ? &NUM . Semantics in performance : how can we extend current syntactically-based accounts with implementable approximations of human semantic knowledge ( lexical , sentential , as well as plausibility ) ?

Yet experience in industry has been the opposite , with a widespread belief that static measures do improve search quality . Because of the necessary secrecy in industry , the belief has not been backed up with proof , peer-reviewed or otherwise . The annual collaborative &NAME Web Track experiments , which I help to coordinate , have been the source of many of the negative results . Are the negative results due to a flaw in the experiments or do they indicate that static measures really are useless ? In this talk I will present a new form of analysis which allows us to evaluate static measures . Results on &NUM different Web crawls show that static measures based on link and &NAME structure are _consistently useful_ , contradicting &NAME results . I will then discuss implications for how we evaluate Web search systems in future . You are currently subscribed to msrclectures as : &EMAIL To unsubscribe send a blank email to &EMAIL ', LEGI

The indexing and retrieval prototype developed within the Scene Of Crime Information System ( SOCIS ) project attempts to go beyond keyword-based approaches and methods that extract syntactic relations from captions . SOCIS relies on advanced Natural Langu age Processing techniques in order to extract relational facts from captions . These relational facts consist of a pragmatic relation \'\' and the entiti es this relation connects ( triples of the form : ARG1- &NAME &NAME ) . In SOCIS , the triples are used as complex image indexing terms ; however , the extraction mechanism is used not only for indexing purposes but also for image retri eval . Extracting the corresponding relational structures from free-natural &NAME uage queries , SOCIS attempts to match the query triples to the indexing triple &CHAR and retrieve the appropriate images with high precision and recall . We have implemented this approach for crime investigation , an application domain where efficient querying of large crime-scene photograph databases is of crucia &CHAR importance . In this presentation , I will start with a demonstration of the current SO &NAME prototype and an overview of the application scenario and I will then foc us on the &NAME techniques used for developing the prototype . The main extraction mechanism will be presented , as well as a preliminary retrieval mechanism ( the \' query triples - indexing triples \' matching mechanism ) .

There are a number of on-going projects on compilation of representative treebanks for languages that still lack them ( Bulgarian , Danish , Portugese , Spanish , Turkish ) and a number of on-going projects on compilation of treebanks for specific purposes for languages that already have them ( &NAME ) . The practices of building syntactically processed corpora have proved that aiming at more detailed description of the data becomes more and more theory-dependent ( &NAME &NAME &NAME and other dependency-based treebanks such as the Danish dependendency treebank , the Italian treebank ( &NAME ) , and the Turkish treebank ( &NAME ) ; &NAME &NAME &NAME , Polish &NAME &NAME , Bulgarian HPSG-based &NAME , etc. ) . Therefore the development of treebanks and formal linguistic theories need to be more tightly connected in order to ensure the necessary information flow between them . This series of workshops aims at being a forum for researchers and advanced students working in these areas . The second workshop will be held in &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NUM november &NUM . ( The first was held in &NAME , &NAME in September &NUM ; see &WEBSITE Topics of interest We invite submission of papers on topics relevant to treebanks and linguistic theories , including but not limited to : - design principles and &NAME schemes for treebanks ; - applications of treebanks in acquiring linguistic knowledge and &NAME ; - the role of linguistic theories in treebank development ; - treebanks as a basis for linguistic research ; - evaluation of treebanks ; - tools for creation and management of treebanks ; - standards for treebanks .

The toolkit allows rapid development of advanced text management applications such as text classification , summarisation , mining and querying . It is uniquely capable of supporting the next generation of such systems , which go beyond pure term indexing or domain-specific entity extraction . The RASP toolkit is a package of text processing modules which annotate text with linguistic information concerning the entities referred to , properties predicated of these relations , and relations which hold between them . For instance , the following text sentence -- from the transcript of President &NAME \'s speech at the &NAME Museum Center on 7th October , &NUM -- is analysed into sets of entities and relations between them some of which are shown underneath : Members of the &NAME of both political parties , and members of the United Nations Security Council , agree that &NAME &NAME is a threat to peace and must disarm . Entities : [ Member+s of the &NAME of both political parties ] [ Member+s ] [ the &NAME ] [ both political parties ] [ political parties ] [ parties ] [ &NAME &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ the United Nations Security Council ] [ United Nations ] [ the Security Council ] [ the Council ] Relations : [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] The actual output of the system further decomposes and classifies these relations and there are other output formats ( href ) Term-based systems represent text documents as bags of words \' ( i.e. sets of characters between white spaces ) but will not directly recover the entities referred to in a document , such as &NAME &NAME \' , political parties \' , the United Nations Security Council \' or \'members of &NAME of both political parties \' . Representing entities rather than terms supports more powerful and precise information management because it provides a better basis for cross indexing variants both within and across documents , such as the &NAME &NAME Council \' or the Security Council \' , and thus also a better way of classifying , summarising or querying document content via salient entities . The RASP system recovers noun phrases referring to entities and classifies them in a domain-independent way into names ( subdivided into places , people , organisations ) , numbers ( including ranges , dates , etc ) , measure phrases ( ounce , year , etc ) , temporal expressions ( days , weeks , months ) , directions ( north , south , etc ) , and so forth . Relational representation of entities provides a natural and effective mechanism for cross-indexing alternate descriptions of entities via subsets of relations ( href ) . Extant systems for extracting entities from text , based on deterministic finite-state pattern matching , rely heavily on manually-supplied domain-specific lexical information from the outset . The relational information recovered by the RASP system can be used to index who did what to whom \' and supports precise querying about the properties predicated of specific entities across a document collection . &CHAR relational pattern like [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] agree [ ? ] \' ( What does the &NAME &NAME Council agree ? \' ) can be matched intelligently against document annotations yielding precise , specific and small amounts of focussed information . This approach to information retrieval deals naturally with non-contiguous text sequences mapping to the same underlying entity or relation ( [ the Security Council ] [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] ) as well as other well known problems with pure term or entity based systems , such as negation ( [ the Council ] [ not agree ] [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] $ neq $ [ the Council ] agree [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] ) . The RASP toolkit achieves about &NUM accuracy recovering entities and relations from arbitrary English texts , without making use of domain-specific lexical information . It has been used to date to analyse about &NUM million words of English . &CHAR recent paper from a refereed conference proceedings gives more details about each module of the toolkit and compares performance to related systems . &NAME and performance for specific applications can be considerably improved by semi-automatic customisation on domain and / or application specific text . The toolkit is fully compatible with existing &NAME standards for text &NAME up and can be used to leverage web sites which will conform with emerging standards for the semantic web ( &NAME / &NAME href ) . The cofounders of &NAME are &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME . The RASP toolkit is the product of collaborative research at the University of &NAME , &NAME Laboratory and University of &NAME , School of Cognitive and Computing Sciences . &NAME &NAME has sole rights to commercial exploitation of the toolkit and works closely with these academic groups to continuously enhance and improve the performance of the toolkit .

Children will also have the opportunity to examine different coping mechanisms to deal with bullying and determine whether these are successful or not . Both technical and psychological teams are involved with the project . The focus of the talk will be on the psychological contribution to the project in terms of developing bullying scenarios for children , the psychological profiles of children involved in bullying , and evaluation techniques for the project .

In ( &NUM ) , the name of a company \' &NAME \' is used to refer to a car produced by that company . Most traditional approaches to metonymy understanding rely on large amounts of world knowledge and are not easily scalable and / or portable . In the MASCARA project we explored supervised statistical classification methods as an alternative approach . We will present the following results : &NUM The regularity and productivity of metonymic readings make it possible to reduce metonymy understanding to a classification task comparable to classic word sense disambiguation for the large majority of metonymic readings . &NUM Grammatical argument-head relations are an appropriate feature for such a classification task and , in particular , more predictive for metonymy recognition than e.g. , collocations . &NUM Data sparseness in argument-head relations can be at least partially overcome by the integration of thesaurus information without increasing the size of the training data . &NUM We also explore the effect that parser accuracy has on the recognition algorithm and compare the difficulty of metonymy recognition to classic word sense disambiguation .

Call for Papers : Journal of &NAME &NAME Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION &NAME editors : &NAME &NAME , &NAME University , &EMAIL &NAME &NAME , University of &NAME , &EMAIL The process of automatically determining the meanings of words , word sense disambiguation ( &NAME ) , is an important stage in language understanding . It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation , information retrieval ( mono- and cross-lingual ) , corpus analysis , summarization and document navigation . The usefulness of &NAME has been acknowledged since the 1950\'s and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of &NAME , an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision / recall comparison of participating systems , which has been run twice to date . The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible . This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on hand-crafted disambiguation rules . This special issue of &NAME &NAME , due for publication in &NUM , is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation . Papers are invited on all aspects of &NAME research , and especially on : * Combinations of methods and knowledge sources . Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information ? How should they be combined ? Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources ? Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another ? * Evaluation of &NAME systems . Which metrics are most informative and would new &NUM be useful ? Can &NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task , for example parsing ? Can evaluations using different data sets ( corpora and lexical resources ) be compared ? Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods ? * Sense distinctions and sense inventories . How do these affect &NAME ? How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the &NAME task ? Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text ? What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done ? * The effect of &NAME on applications . To what extent does &NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval ? What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications ? What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes ? * Minimising the need for hand-tagged data . Hand-tagged text is expensive and difficult to obtain while un-tagged text is plentiful and , effectively , limitless . What techniques can be used to make use of un-tagged text , would weakly / semi-supervised learning algorithms be useful ? What use can be made of parallel text ? Can un-tagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text ?

ac.uk, '', 'CALL FOR PAPERS ACL-2003 Workshop on &NAME Expressions : &NAME , &NAME and &NAME &NUM July &NUM , &NAME , &NAME * * * &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM April &NUM * * * WEBSITES Workshop website : &WEBSITE &NAME website : &WEBSITE WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION &NAME expressions ( &NAME ) include a large range of linguistic phenomenon , such as phrasal verbs ( e.g. \' add up \' ) , nominal compounds ( e.g. \' telephone box \' ) , and institutionalized phrases ( e.g. \'salt and &NAME \' ) , and they can be syntactically and / or semantically idiosyncratic in nature . &NAME are used frequently in everyday language , usually to express precisely ideas and concepts that cannot be compressed into a single word . &CHAR considerable amount of research has been devoted to this subject , both in terms of theory and practice , but despite increasing interest in idiomaticity within linguistic research , there is still a gap between the needs of &NAME and the descriptive tradition of linguistics . Owing to the lack of adequate resources to identify and treat &NAME properly , they pose a real challenge for &NAME . Most real-world applications tend to ignore &NAME or address them simply by listing . However , it is clear that successful applications will need to be able to identify and treat them appropriately . This particularly applies to the many applications which require some degree of semantic processing ( e.g. machine translation , question-answering , summarisation , generation ) . In recent years there has been a growing awareness in the &NAME community of the problems that &NAME pose and the need for their robust handling . &CHAR considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area , some within large research projects dedicated to &NAME ( e.g. the &NAME Expression Project ) . There is also a growing interest in &NAME in projects focused on tasks such as parsing ( e.g. Robust Accurate &NAME &NAME ( RASP ) ) and word sense disambiguation ( e.g. MEANING - &NAME &NAME &NAME Language Technologies ) which are required by real-world applications . Previous workshops on &NAME have focused on certain &NAME types , notably collocations , terminology and named entities . There are , however , further subtypes of &NAME , which are highly relevant for &NAME tasks but which have not to date received specific attention . &NUM example are lexicalised ( non- or semi-compositional ) &NAME which raise specific issues for applications which require semantic interpretation . TARGET AUDIENCE This workshop is intended to bring together &NAME researchers working on all areas of &NAME . The objective is to summarise what has been achieved in the area , to establish common themes between different approaches , and to discuss future trends , with particular emphasis on addressing the problems that different &NAME ( sub ) types pose for real-world &NAME applications . AREAS OF INTEREST Papers are invited on , but not limited to , the following topics : * Theoretical research on &NAME * &NAME taxonomies , classifications and databases * Corpus based analysis of &NAME * Cross-lingual analysis of &NAME types , use , and behaviour * Methods for identification and extraction of &NAME ( machine learning , statistical , example- or rule-based , or hybrid ) * Evaluation of &NAME extraction methods * Integration of &NAME data into grammars and &NAME applications ( e.g. machine translation and generation ) * &NAME &NAME ( or &NAME types ) pose for &NAME applications and solutions proposed Papers can cover &NUM or more of these areas . SUBMISSION INFORMATION Papers should be submitted electronically in Postscript or &NAME format to : &EMAIL . Submissions should conform to the two-column format of &NAME proceedings and should not exceed &NUM ( &SMILEY pages , including references .

LEGITIMATE AND LEGAL THIS IS A LEGITIMATE , LEGAL , MONEY MAKING OPPORTUNITY . It does not require you to come into contact with people , do any hard work and best of all , you never have to leave the house except to get the mail . If you believe that someday you \'ll get that big break that you \'ve been waiting for , THIS IS IT ! Simply follow the instructions , and your dreams will come true . This e-mail marketing program works perfectly ... &NUM , EVERY TIME . E-mail is the sales tool of the future . Take advantage of this non-commercialized method of advertising NOW ! ! ! The longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . Get your piece of this program now ! MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING ( &NAME ) has finally gained respectability . It is being taught in the &NAME Business School , both &NAME Research and the &NAME &NAME &NAME have stated that between &NUM and &NUM of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the next &NUM years . This is a &NAME Dollar industry and of the &NUM , &NUM millionaires in the &NAME , &NUM ( &NUM , &NUM ) made their fortune in the last few years in &NAME . Moreover , statistics show &NUM people become millionaires everyday through &NAME &NAME . You may have heard this story before , but over the summer &NAME &NAME made an appearance on the &NAME &NAME &NAME . &NAME asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . Without hesitating , &NAME said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . The audience started to hoot and boo him . He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response - \' That \'s why I \'m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! \' With network marketing you have &NUM sources of income . Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . Residual income is the secret of the wealthy . It means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . In network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers . Fortunately , sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . My name is &NAME &NAME . &NUM years ago , the corporation I worked for , the past &NUM years , down-sized and my position was eliminated . After many unproductive job interviews , I decided to open my own business . Over the past year , I incurred many unforeseen financial problems . I owed my family , friends and creditors over $ &NUM , &NUM . I just could n\'t seem to make ends meet . I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life , FINANCIALLY , FOREVER ! ! ! In mid December , I received this program via e-mail . &NUM month \'s prior to receiving this program I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . All of the programs I received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . One claimed that I would make a million dollars in &NUM year ... it did n\'t tell me I \'d have to write a best selling book to make it ! But , as I was saying , in December of &NUM I received this program . I did n\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT ! After reading it several times , to make sure I was reading it correctly , I could n\'t believe my eyes . Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON . I could invest as much as I wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out , I would at least get my money back . But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . So I checked it out with the &NAME &NAME Office ( &NUM &NUM 24-hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER , I decided \' WHY NOT . \' Initially I sent out &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The great thing about e-mail is that I do n\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . I \'m telling you as it is , I hope it does n\'t turn you off , but I promised myself that I would not \' rip-off \' anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . In less than &NUM week , I was starting to receive orders for REPORT # &NUM . By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . Your goal is to \'RECEIVE at least &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . If you do n\'t, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO ! \' My first step in making $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM days was done . By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . Your goal is to \'RECEIVE AT LEAST &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . IF NOT , SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO . ONCE YOU HAVE &NUM ORDERS , THE REST IS EASY , RELAX , YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $ &NUM , &NUM GOAL . \' Well , I had &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , &NUM more than I needed . So I sat back and relaxed . By March &NUM , of my e-mailing of &NUM , &NUM , I received $ &NUM , &NUM with more coming in every day . I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car . Please take time to read the attached program , IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER ! Remember , it wo n\'t work if you do n\'t try it . This program does work , but you must follow it EXACTLY ! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . It wo n\'t work , you \'ll lose out on a lot of money ! In order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , and &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM and you will make $ &NUM , &NUM or more in &NUM days . I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS ! If you choose not to participate in this program , I am sorry . It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . If you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . If you are a business owner and in financial trouble , as I was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a good luck sign . I DID ! Sincerely , &NAME &NAME &NAME Do you have any idea what $ &NUM , &NUM looks like piled up on a kitchen table ? IT \'S AWESOME ! &CHAR PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM : By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program , one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . Let me tell you a little about myself . I had a profitable business for &NUM years . Then in &NUM my business began falling off . I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\'t working . Finally , I figured it out . It was n\'t me , it was the economy . &NAME and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since &NUM . I do n\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate ... because many of you know from first hand experience . There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . The middle class was vanishing . Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . Those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . As the saying goes , \' THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER . \' The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \'move up \' or \' get &NAME \' . You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \' NO RISK \' and \' JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT . \' You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . I have already made over &NUM MILLION DOLLARS ! I have retired from the program after sending out over &NUM , &NUM programs . Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED . Do not change it in any way . It works exceedingly well as it is now . Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . One of the people you send this to may send out &NUM , &NUM ... and your name will be on everyone of them ! Remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . So my friend , I have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , IT IS NOW UP TO YOU ! HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WORKS HERE \'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU &NUM OF DOLLARS INSTRUCTIONS : This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS &NUM \% , EVERY TIME . I am sure that you could use up to $ &NUM , &NUM or more in the next &NUM days . Before you say \' BULL ... \' , please read this program carefully . This is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . Basically , this is what you do : As with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . Every state in the &NAME allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent .

When I received the program I grumbled to &NAME about receiving \' junk mail . \' I made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved .

Not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan .

THANK \'S TO THE COMPUTER &NAME AND THE INTERNET AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV : PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! Does this headline look familiar ? Of course it does . You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . And reported elsewhere in the world . His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . &NAME Bills , &NUM , &NUM and Hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . \'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM Dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . He came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive Several Thousand Dollars in &NAME Bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM Bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM plus - please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! Before you say \' \' &NAME \'\' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can \' follow the simple instruction \' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \'\' . DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . This is what one had to say : \' \' Thanks to this profitable opportunity \' . I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . To my astonishment , I received a total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in \'\' . &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME . Another said : \' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . I followed the simple instructions and &NAME . . ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in.

Please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions . PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! Does this headline look familiar ? Of course it does . You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . And reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods &NAME &NAME ) . His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . Five-dollar bills , &NUM , &NUM and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . \'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had &NAME came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' I did n\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like &NUM thousand at a time in my backpack . I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] &WEBSITE time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but I just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . \' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! Before you say \' &NAME \' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \' . DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . NOTE * follow the directons below , I hade best results the second time when I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . I have been asked many times to recommend whom to use . However , after using &NUM particular company many , many times and had absolutely no problems with them . I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of a discount offer . They will send &NUM million email offers for $ &NUM or &NUM million for $ &NUM .. Remember this is recommended not Required . In order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . I have been extremely successful using the this company . They send out the offers , and all I do is accept money for reports , then I send back to the people as soon as possible This is what one had to say : \' Thanks to this profitable opportunity . I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . To my astonishment , I received total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in \' . &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME . Here is another testimonial : \' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . I followed the simple instructions and walaa . ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $ &NUM . &NUM but the next &NUM months after that I made a total of $ &NUM , &NUM . So far , in the past &NUM months by re- entering the program , I have made over $ &NUM , &NUM and I am playing it again . The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything . \' More testimonials later but first , +++ PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE +++ +++ Order all &NUM reports shown on the list below +++ For each report , send $ &NUM CASH , THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report .

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , 000e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receive only a &NUM response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM . Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . That equals &NUM people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM million e-mails sent out . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . THAT \'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH3D $ &NUM , &NUM ( half million ) . Your total income in this example is : &NUM . . ... $ &NUM &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM . . . . . ... &NAME &NAME $ &NUM , &NUM NUMBERS DO NOT &NAME . GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT , YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! REMEMBER FRIEND , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , 000e-mails each or more ? There are over &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting . Believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! METHOD # &NUM : BY PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add METHOD # &NUM as you go along . For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered . That \'s it . Always provide same day service on all orders . This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . ++++++++++++++ AVAILABLE REPORTS +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY . &NAME : Always send $ &NUM cash ( &NAME CURRENCY ) for each Report .

I am writing this letter from &NAME , &NAME , to solicit for your special assistance to my family shattered by a tyrannical government led by a dictator and his ( ZANU-PF ) ruling party , President &NAME &NAME . Because of land and farmland crisis in &NAME the government Secretly sponsored the war veterans and some irate party members to disposed the land being occupied by the white farmers .

com.tw, 'Good news for &NAME ', '&NAME . &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME ISLAND BRANCH LAGOS . - &NAME . Dear Sir , I am &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME Manager of &NAME of &NAME , Lagos &NAME . I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you . On June &NUM , &NUM , a Canadian Oil consultant / contractor with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation , Mr. &NAME &NAME made a numbered time ( &NAME ) Deposit for &NUM calendar months , valued at US $ &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM &NUM &NUM Dollars ) in my branch . Upon maturity , I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply . After a month , we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers , the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that Mr. &NAME &NAME died from an automobile accident . On further investigation , I found out that he died without making &CHAR WILL , and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless . I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. &NAME &NAME did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents , including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank . This sum of US $ &NUM , &NUM , &NUM is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year . No one has ever come forward to claim it . According to Nigerian Law , at the expiration of &NUM ( &NUM ) years , the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund . Consequently , my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. &NAME &NAME so that the fruits of this old man \'s labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government officials . This is simple , I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin . We shall employ the service of &NUM Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate / administration in your favor for the transfer . &CHAR bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary / next of kin . The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of &NUM for me and &NUM for you . There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and my position as the &NAME Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction . If you are interested , please reply immediately via the private email address below . Upon your response , I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction . Please observe utmost confidentiality , and be rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country .

org, '$ &NUM , &NUM - cash in &NUM year old son closet found by his Mom ! ', 'All our mailings are sent complying to the proposed H.R. &NUM Unsolicited Commercial Electronic Mail Act of &NUM . Please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions . PARENTS OF 15-YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! Does this headline look familiar ? Of course it does . You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . And reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods - &NAME &NAME ) . His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet.Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . Five-dollar bills , &NUM , &NUM and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles &NAME first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . He came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down , and to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' I did n\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like &NUM thousand at a time in my backpack . I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] &WEBSITE time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but I just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . \' Surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all . In fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' . This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM - please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! Before you say \' &NAME \' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \' . DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . NOTE * follow the directions below , I had best results the second time when I hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . I have been asked many times to recommend whom to use . However , after using &NUM particular company many , many times and had absolutely no problems with them . I took it upon myself to discuss the possibility of a discount offer . They will send &NUM million email offers for $ &NUM or &NUM million for $ &NUM .. Remember this is recommended not required . In order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . I have been extremely successful using the this company . They &CHAR nd out the offers , and all I do is accept the money for reports , which I send back to the people as soon as possible . This is what one had to say : \' Thanks to this profitable opportunity . I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . To my astonishment , I received total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in \' . &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME . Here is another testimonial : \' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . I followed the simple instructions and walaa ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $ &NUM . &NUM but the next &NUM months after that I made a total of $ &NUM , &NUM . So far , in the past &NUM months by re- entering the program , I have made over $ &NUM , &NUM and I am playing it again . The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything . \' More testimonials later but first , +++ PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE +++ +++ Order all &NUM reports shown on the list below +++ For each report , send $ &NUM CASH , THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report .

IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step \' &NUM through &NUM \' or you will loose out on majority of your profits . Once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . Remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter , it will NOT work ! ! ! People have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all &NUM thinking they could get all the money . But it does not work this way . Believe us , we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed . Because if you do , it will not work for you .

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receive only a &NUM response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM . Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . That equals &NUM people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM million e-mails sent out . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM .

It was on transit with a safe deposit company here in &NAME , when the tragic incident of my Uncle \'s death occurred . As a matter of fact , this is the reason I chose to come to &NAME to seek political asylum . It is very clear with the way things are now , that President &NAME &NAME will lobby the International Community to freeze my Uncle \'s assets and accounts abroad , to ground UNITA , since he has already done this in &NAME . I plan to use this money to safeguard my future . It is very essential that you understand that the kind of trust and confidence I want to put in you is extraordinary , and an act of desperation on my part , in order not to lose this money . Please , treat this contact with utmost secrecy and confidentiality for security and safety reasons .

The longer you wait , the more people will be doing business using e-mail . Get your piece of this program now ! MULTI-LEVEL MARKETING ( &NAME ) has finally gained respectability . It is being taught in the &NAME Business School , both &NAME Research and the &NAME &NAME &NAME have stated that between &NUM and &NUM of all goods and services will be sold through multi-level methods by the next &NUM years . This is a &NAME Dollar industry and of the &NUM , &NUM millionaires in the &NAME , &NUM ( &NUM , &NUM ) made their fortune in the last few years in &NAME . Moreover , statistics show &NUM people become millionaires everyday through &NAME &NAME . You may have heard this story before , but over the summer &NAME &NAME made an appearance on the &NAME &NAME &NAME . &NAME asked him what he would do if he lost everything and had to start over from scratch . Without hesitating , &NAME said he would find a good network marketing company and get to work . The audience started to hoot and boo him . He looked out at the audience and dead-panned his response - \' That \'s why I \'m sitting up here and you are all sitting out there ! \' With network marketing you have &NUM sources of income . Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . Residual income is the secret of the wealthy . It means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . In network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers . Fortunately , sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . My name is &NAME &NAME . &NUM years ago , the corporation I worked for , the past &NUM years , down-sized and my position was eliminated . After many unproductive job interviews , I decided to open my own business . Over the past year , I incurred many unforeseen financial problems . I owed my family , friends and creditors over $ &NUM , &NUM . I just could n\'t seem to make ends meet . I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life , FINANCIALLY , FOREVER ! ! ! In mid December , I received this program via e-mail . &NUM month \'s prior to receiving this program I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . All of the programs I received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . One claimed that I would make a million dollars in &NUM year ... it did n\'t tell me I \'d have to write a best selling book to make it ! But , as I was saying , in December of &NUM I received this program . I did n\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT ! After reading it several times , to make sure I was reading it correctly , I could n\'t believe my eyes . Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON . I could invest as much as I wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out , I would at least get my money back . But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . So I checked it out with the &NAME &NAME Office ( &NUM &NUM 24-hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER , I decided \' WHY NOT . \' Initially I sent out &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The great thing about e-mail is that I do n\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . I \'m telling you as it is , I hope it does n\'t turn you off , but I promised myself that I would not \' rip-off \' anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . In less than &NUM week , I was starting to receive orders for REPORT # &NUM . By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . Your goal is to \'RECEIVE at least &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . If you do n\'t, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO ! \' My first step in making $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM days was done . By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . Your goal is to \'RECEIVE AT LEAST &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . IF NOT , SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO . ONCE YOU HAVE &NUM ORDERS , THE REST IS EASY , RELAX , YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $ &NUM , &NUM GOAL . \' Well , I had &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , &NUM more than I needed . So I sat back and relaxed . By March &NUM , of my e-mailing of &NUM , &NUM , I received $ &NUM , &NUM with more coming in every day . I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car . Please take time to read the attached program , IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER ! Remember , it wo n\'t work if you do n\'t try it . This program does work , but you must follow it EXACTLY ! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . It wo n\'t work , you \'ll lose out on a lot of money ! In order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , and &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM and you will make $ &NUM , &NUM or more in &NUM days . I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS ! If you choose not to participate in this program , I am sorry . It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . If you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . If you are a business owner and in financial trouble , as I was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a good luck sign . I DID ! Sincerely , &NAME &NAME &NAME Do you have any idea what $ &NUM , &NUM looks like piled up on a kitchen table ? IT \'S AWESOME ! &CHAR PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM : By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program , one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . Let me tell you a little about myself . I had a profitable business for &NUM years . Then in &NUM my business began falling off . I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\'t working . Finally , I figured it out . It was n\'t me , it was the economy . &NAME and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since &NUM . I do n\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate ... because many of you know from first hand experience . There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . The middle class was vanishing . Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . Those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . As the saying goes , \' THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER . \' The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \'move up \' or \' get &NAME \' . You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \' NO RISK \' and \' JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT . \' You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . I have already made over &NUM MILLION DOLLARS ! I have retired from the program after sending out over &NUM , &NUM programs . Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED . Do not change it in any way . It works exceedingly well as it is now . Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . One of the people you send this to may send out &NUM , &NUM ... and your name will be on everyone of them ! Remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . So my friend , I have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , IT IS NOW UP TO YOU ! HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WORKS HERE \'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU &NUM OF DOLLARS INSTRUCTIONS : This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS &NUM \% , EVERY TIME . I am sure that you could use up to $ &NUM , &NUM or more in the next &NUM days . Before you say \' BULL ... \' , please read this program carefully . This is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . Basically , this is what you do : As with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . Every state in the &NAME allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent . YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL , so you are not involved in personal selling . You do it privately in your own home , store or office .

THANK \'S TO THE COMPUTER &NAME AND THE INTERNET AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV : PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! Does this headline look familiar ? Of course it does . You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . And reported elsewhere in the world . His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . &NAME Bills , &NUM , &NUM and Hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . \'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM Dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . He came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive Several Thousand Dollars in &NAME Bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not with magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM Bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM plus - please continue reading .
