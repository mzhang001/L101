The work makes a systematic effort to analyse and describe the current research and thinking in this field , emphasizing the multi-disciplinary nature of the subject . The volumes are arranged thematically with each volume dedicated to a particular area of specialisation . In planning the presentation of the Encyclopaedia the main consideration has been in selecting material which present particular theme or idea in a most comprehensive manner making the understanding of this subject much easier . The main focus in the preparation of this work has been to make it useful for not only the specialist scholars and researchers but also for those wide range of potential users\' individuals and institutions\' in need of information in this diverse field . Although the main thrust is on dealing with all major areas in the field of language and linguistics in as comprehensive a manner as possible by treating the \' core \' areas thoroughly , the focus is also on including the new and emergent issues as well . A significant feature of the Encyclopaedia is its interdisciplinary nature , thus enough space is devoted to aspects of Sociology , Social Development , &NAME , &NAME and Philosophy that impinge on Language . The work is full of examples and illustrations and contains references and bibliography for each individual subjects being covered . The comprehensiveness of the scope of this &NAME is indicated by the vast amount of material included covering on one \' hand linguistics as a Science and on the other the Philosophy of linguistics . It includes Structural linguistics trying to discover the rules of phonology , morphology and syntax that predict how most speakers of the language talk . The Historical Linguistic covers comparative analysis of cognates and grammar testing the notion that certain languages derive from common ancestral language . The goals are to reconstruct the features of the Protolanguage , to hypothesize how the off spring languages separated from each other and to establish its common origin . The volume on &NAME linguistics includes contributions from leaders in this field covering the concepts , language development and functions in detail . Development of language and its principles has been dealt with separately Recently &NAME have begun to study variations in how people actually use language . This type of linguistic study called &NAME concerned with the ethnography of speaking is also dealt with in a separate volume . The Encyclopaedia includes important contributions on the fast developing area of &NAME by contributors who are working on the \' frontiers \' of the study of Language and Linguistics . Apart from this , the Encyclopaedia covers all major core areas in &NAME &NAME , Development of Language , &NAME , &NAME , Language and Social Development , Problems and Methods In Linguistics and Strategies for Growth and Change . Readable , comprehensive and current , the Encyclopaedia of Language and Linguistics is intended to serve as a standard reference work in this fast developing and changing discipline .

ac.uk, 'Re : C++ ', 'Hi &NAME , continuing on from the last email I sent , sorry about the delay - my code is like a badly sown dress - I pull &NUM thread and spend the next few hours finding where I pulled it apart ! ! anyway here are the results , as in the last email tungsten example might not result in increase in &NAME , although better than before . question &NUM however does improve when using a partial &NAME here , \' her \' is resolved to \' actress \' , \' &NAME \' , and \' &NAME \' through &NAME her - &NAME resolution . As there are very few &NAME matches , the direct substitution results in improvement for these cases . Perhaps that is a further argument that combined with more complex system that incorporates NE - the system could prefer equal ranking sentences in which the required NE occurs etc ? anyway table &NUM again ! : &WEBSITE &CHAR &CHAR &CHAR &CHAR &NAME - the normal run &NAME baseline + antecedent - manual replacement of sentences + direct substitution - automatic substitution of the pronoun for the antecedent in the original submission sentences . &NAME - only related &NAME elements &NAME - all elements The only example where the inner improved using the partial &NAME was in the case of question &NUM where the context was : \' &NAME &NAME &NAME , mistress of &NAME &NAME &NAME , has been dead for almost &NUM years , but someone remembers . Earlier this week , a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in &NAME Memorial Park . Dear &NAME , you are still loved and missed , read the accompanying note . \' The original submission sentence read : \' &NAME &NAME &NAME , mistress of &NAME &NAME &NAME , has been dead for almost &NUM years , but someone remembers . \' however , after pulling in \' actress \' , \' &NAME \' and \' &NAME \' ( as all &NUM had \' &NAME \' arg ) the &NAME selected the correct ( following ) sentence : Earlier this week , a fan left a red rose on her mausoleum in &NAME Memorial Park . Earlier this week , a fan left a red rose on actress &NAME &NAME mausoleum in &NAME Memorial Park . The real problem is that the shallow parsed &NAME structures result in very few &NAME elements - so the &NAME system is already based mainly upon &NAME and CARG matches . Therefore without &NAME &NAME representations to start with you are almost always only pulling in the antecedent itself . hope that \'s ok - I \'ll be home tomorrow morning if you need to call me ! &NAME : ) On &NAME &NUM &NUM , &NAME &NAME wrote : ', LEGI

ac.uk, 'Past Presidents \' Politics ', 'Dear &NAME , While I have great respect , both personal and professional , for all our past presidents , I regret that they have chosen to involve us , as &NAME , in this matter . Although the Presidents state further down in their letter that they are actually divided over the boycott issue and over &NAME &NAME \'s actions , the first line of their letter reads : \' We are writing in support of &NAME &NAME \' . There is no doubt that this line will now receive wide citation in the campaign that supports &NAME &NAME , both in her dispute with &NAME and in her so-called \' personal \' boycott of &NAME nationals . It may not have been their intention , but with this choice of emphasis the Presidents have given their name , and ours -- for they say : \' We may speak for many in our field because we are the recent past presidents of the Linguistics Association of &NAME &NAME \' -- to a campaign that says that it is right to limit individuals \' academic freedom if they have a particular nationality , that it is correct to ban fellow scholars not due to their poor professional ethics or even on the basis of their political views but simply because of their place of work ( for those of you who do n\'t know : both of &NAME \'s boycottees are prominent pro-Palestinian human rights activists ) , and that it is legitimate to put political blame for the actions taken by a government on individual fellow academics , although this clearly only holds for &NAME working in &NAME ( I assume that none of us would dream of boycotting , say , Russian colleagues in protest against the flattening of &NAME , or American colleagues in protest against civilian casualties in &NAME , or Turkish colleagues in protest against the -- still existing -- ban on using &NAME in public , etc etc ) . The Presidents even go on to say that \' we all agree that the discrimination by &NAME against the &NAME raises issues that are far more serious than the academic boycott , and we regret the way that this issue is serving to divert attention . \' I do not find that acting or arguing against boycotting individuals on the basis of their nationality ( rather than point of view or actions ) diverts either my attention or my energy away from engaging actively for peace in the Middle East . Quite to the contrary : as an &NAME who has been activley engaged in dialogue with Palestinian friends and colleagues for over &NUM decades now , I feel that the only hope we have is to continue to make use of the freedoms we have as academics to meet and draft ideas for a better future , and for life in peace and collaboration in a country which we must share . Recall that the talks that had led to the &NAME accords of the early &NUM ( which &NAME appears to oppose , but which brought the only prospect of peace for over a century ) , had been initiated by Palestinian and &NAME academics , meeting abroad , defying a ban on contacts issued by hardliners on both sides . If we restrict our own freedoms by banning contacts , as &NAME wants , we are doing a service only to those whose aim is to separate our &NUM peoples and to prevent them from ever reaching any common ground . The Presidents raise concern over \' the potential infringement of &NAME \'s liberty \' , and say that \' Whether or not an individual academic wishes to engage outside the university in a political action , such as the boycott of the &NAME academic community , is not an issue for the employing organisation . \' . I strongly disagree . &NUM cannot pretend that we are talking about what an individual acdemic is doing in her free time . The issue is rather , which standards of academic practice are being set in the public life of our own academic community . &NAME \'s actions were not personal ; they were public gestures by a senior colleague , aimed at changing the standards by which most of us operate . As members of an academic association in this country , it is our right and our duty to engage in a debate on where and how to set the standards of academic practice and behaviour . It is also the right and duty of the leadership of any academic institution to engage in this debate . The issue of whether or not it is acceptable to ban fellow academics based on their nationality or country of residence or place of work belongs to the code of practice of this academic community . The issue of whether or not &NAME discriminates the &NAME ( or &NAME the &NAME , or &NAME the Catholics in &NAME &NAME ) , or how to react to such discrimination , does not belong to that code of practice , and is beyond the remit of either the &NAME or an academic institution like &NAME . In this last respect , I very much regret the double standards that we seem to have in the &NAME : Last autumn , at the &NAME business meeting , I proposed that we should react to the press reports concerning the &NAME Secretary \'s statements on the use of mother tongue by immigrants in their homes . Instead of deciding to act , the assembly accepted a proposal that I should first establish what exactly had been said , that I should then put together a report summarising current research on bilingualism in the family , that I should then draft a reaction citing this research , and then go on to poll the membership via this list , and hope to come up with an agreed statement still to be issued before public opinion completely lost interest in the matter . It turned out that &NAME had not said what some of the press attributed to him . Nonetheless , his statement was ambiguous enough to deserve , in my opinion , a reaction clarifying that it is incorrect and improper to suggest a link between linguistic diversity and lack of modernity ( &NAME \'s text suggested a link between acquiring English and modernity , while addressing the alleged monolingualism of a large proportion of immigrants ) . But it took many days to negotiate a text to present on this list , and even the text that was agreed on was not , for some reason , passed on to the list , but was substituted by a notice stripped of any evaluative content . The &NAME was not , it seemed , as interested in reacting to an issue situated on its own doorstep and which demanded its profesional expertise , as much as it enjoys the inspiration of &NAME &NAME \'s \' ban them ! \' campaign . Perhaps it \'s pity that the powers that determine events in &NAME / &NAME are even less affected by what the &NAME says than the British &NAME Secretary . &NAME &NAME ', LEGI

To that end , I \'m writing to suggest that you each make available to the other people on this list your contribution to the evolang . volume . I hope and assume that you are currently revising your paper , so I feel it makes sense for you to distribute it as soon as you have a revised version that people could look at . I \'ll leave you each to decide on the best way to do this , but would ask firstly that you undertake to distribute your paper in some way , for instance by sending round an attachment . ( This list contains only papers that I consider to be related in some way ( &NUM in total ) , so I \'ve already taken some of the work out of the procedure . ) Secondly , I ask that you undertake to look at the contributions so received , and refer to them ( as \' &NAME , this volume \' ) where there are interesting relevant points of overlap or controversy , agreement or dispute . Here , I summarise briefly the contents / key words of the papers on the list ( with apologies to anyone I \'ve misrepresented - please let me know ! ) : &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME ; &NAME &NAME : \' Cultural selection for learnability : &NUM hypotheses concerning the characteristic structure of language \' .

( a correlated simulation model ; genetic assimilation ; protolanguage as learnable without a specific language faculty - can be culturally transmitted ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME : \' Evolution of language diversity : the survival of the fitness \' . ( Although the assumption that language increases human evolutionary fitness is intuitively appealing , its validity needs to be examined in the light of the indications that a coherent language can emerge in the absence of language-related fitness , e.g. , through a combination of genetic drift and random population diffusion ; computer modelling ) &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME : \' Acquisition and evolution of natural languages : &NUM puzzles for the price of one \' . ( simulations charting the emergence and stability of irregularities across &NUM generations of artificial simplicity-based learners using a rudimentary language ; the stability of irregularities in lg . ; &NAME \'s Paradox . ) &NAME &NAME : \' Meaning coordination and communicative success \' ( most previous simulations of lg . evolution avoid the problem of learning meanings ; this investigates instead the emergence of communication systems without innate or transferable meanings ) . &NAME &NAME : \' Simulating the evolution of a grammar for case \' ( presents a multi-agent model in which steps towards the evolution of a grammar for case are simulated . Grammar is seen as an evolving adaptive system that is shaped and negotiated by the agents as they optimise communication . ) Please let me know if there are any problems or other matters that I can help with .

In this talk , \' duality \' refers to the fact that given a data set , one might arbitrarily choose to perform either query-oriented estimation or document-oriented estimation . I explain that this duality is not a choice , but a problem , for almost any conceivable approach to parameter estimation in &NAME , and it is rarely adequately addressed . Early Language &NAME efforts made this problem worse , in some respects , but a consensus is emerging about how to solve the problem . I will present a probabilistic solution , whose principles can be adapted to a wide variety of &NAME models ( i.e. even non-probabilistic &NUM ) . Experiments using the proposed solution show that , at least in &NUM respect , queries are as informative as documents are , contrary to a widely held belief .

This model informs many aspects of the work - - the kinds of theoretical approach taken , many implementation issues including the design of efficient , fast-response systems , the measurement of effectiveness and the qualitative testing of systems . However , we may take a number of different views of the information task itself and the user context in which that task occurs . &NUM alternative is represented by the filtering task , as defined for the &NAME exercise . Here filtering is seen as a content-based , adaptive task applied to an incoming stream of documents , involving user needs represented by profiles . In this talk , I will explore the nature of this task , and some of the ways in which it must be treated differently from the canonical model . I will address both conceptual and implementation issues , and discuss some experimental results from &NAME .

Call for Papers : Journal of &NAME &NAME Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION &NAME editors : &NAME &NAME , &EMAIL &NAME &NAME , &EMAIL The process of automatically determining the meanings of words , word sense disambiguation ( &NAME ) , is an important stage in language understanding . It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation , information retrieval ( mono- and cross-lingual ) , corpus analysis , summarization and document navigation . The importance of &NAME has been acknowledged since the 1950\'s and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of &NAME , an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision / recall comparison of participating systems , which has been run twice to date . The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible . This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on hand-crafted disambiguation rules . This special issue of the Journal of &NAME &NAME , due for publication in July &NUM , is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation . Papers are invited on all aspects of &NAME research , and especially on : * Combinations of methods and knowledge sources . Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information ? How should they be combined ? Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources ? Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another ? * Evaluation of &NAME systems . Which metrics are most informative and would new &NUM be useful ? Can &NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task , for example parsing ? Can evaluations using different data sets ( corpora and lexical resources ) be compared ? Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods ? * Sense distinctions and sense inventories . How do these affect &NAME ? How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the &NAME task ? Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text ? What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done ? * The effect of &NAME on applications . To what extent does &NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval ? What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications ? What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes ? * Minimising the need for handtagged data . &NAME text is expensive and difficult to obtain while untagged text is plentiful and , effectively , limitless . What techniques can be used to make use of untagged text , would weakly / semi-supervised learning algorithms be useful ? What use can be made of parallel text ? Can untagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text ?

They asked me to organize something that would allow everyone to get the chance to explain what they are doing , on an informal basis . However , for the aim to be reached , it is important that everyone of us takes part in the event . Attendance is therefore highly recommended ( not to say obligatory ) . The plan , given that we are &NUM of us , is to held &NUM afternoons at a few weeks \' interval . All members of the group would give a &NUM min talk , &NUM on each afternoon . Rather than being about results of the research only , these talks should mostly be a short description of current research , methods and tools used and designed , problems met , ie. points that can be useful for the entire group , and about which some useful feedback or ideas could be given by other members of the group .

The symposium aims to encourage a dialogue between various workers in areas that might benefit from a possible common framework addressing evolvability and sensor / effector evolution . The symposium addresses &NUM aspects that are believed to be central in understanding fundamental biological mechanisms , like information information discovery , acquisition , processing and transmission , both on the level of populations and individuals : these mechanisms are evolvability and sensor evolution . &NAME Darwinian evolution characterized by heritable variation and selection is not by itself sufficient to account for the capacity to vary and inherent phenotypic expressions of fitness . Rigidity of genotype-phenotype mappings , as often used in evolutionary computation , constrains the dynamics of evolution to a small space of possible biological or artificial systems . Open-ended evolution is not possible under such constraints . &NAME , by itself , cannot fully explain the advant of genetic systems , the flexible genotype-phenotype mappings , heritable fitness . This presents a challenge both to biologists seeking to understand the capacity of life to evolve and to computer scientists who seek to harness biological-like robustness and openness in the evolution of artificial systems . To what extent does evolvability require a population of discrete individuals on which to act ? How can higher levels of sensory individuality arise ? &NAME has been variously defined as the \' genome \'s ability to produce adaptive variants when acted on by the genetic system \' ( &NAME & &NAME , &NUM ) , as the \' capacity to generate heritable phenotypic variation \' ( &NAME & &NAME , &NUM ) ; and as characterized by evolutionary watersheds \' opening the \' floodgates to future evolution \' , such as segmentation and body plans ( &NAME , &NUM ) . On the other hand , unconstrained or inappropriately constrained variability and change can lead to lack of stability , \' cancer \' , nonheritability of fitness , lack of evolutionary power , and so on . &NAME &NAME In natural evolution one finds impressive examples of the principle of exploiting and creating new sensory channels and information they carry . &NAME , tactile , auditory and visual , but also e.g. electrical and even magnetic senses have evolved in a multitude of variants , often utilizing organs not originally \' intended \' for the purpose they serve at present . Biologically evolving systems are able to adaptively construct their own hardware and software . The new sensors create new ways of giving meaning to and interpreting the world . Many biological sensors reach a degree of structural and functional complexity and of efficiency which is envied by engineers creating man-made sensors . Sensors enable animals to survive in dynamic and unstructured environments , to perceive and react appropriately to features in the biotic and abiotic environment , including members of the own species as well as predators and prey . &NAME artificial sensors for hardware or software systems suggests a similar approach taken for generating life-like behaviour , namely using evolutionary techniques in order to explore design spaces and generate sensors which are specifically adapted with respect to environmental and other fitness related constraints . The creation of channels of sensory input and effectory output lead to higher evolvability as new relevance criteria are developed that confer a survival advantage to future offspring .

While both platforms promise to be more cost effective than their monolithic predecessors , they suffer from increased failure rates ( as high as one failed processor a day ) due their size and the fact that they are not manufactured by a single entity . At the same time many computational tasks like protein folding and materials science simulations are becoming larger , taking weeks , months or even a year to compute . In short , program runtimes are greatly exceeding the meantime to failure of their platforms . Our work deals with automatic methods for enabling applications to survive hardware faults . We have developed a way of recording program state at the application-level by using a preprocessor to get the program save its own state . Furthermore , we have developed and implemented a distributed coordination protocol that arranges checkpoints from individual processors into a consistent global recovery line . When any processors fail , everybody else can roll back to their most recent checkpoint and resume their computation , with very little work lost .

ac.uk, '', '2nd CALL FOR PAPERS &ORG-2003 Workshop on &NAME Expressions : &NAME , &NAME and &NAME &NUM July &NUM , &NAME , &NAME WEBSITES Workshop website : &WEBSITE &NAME website : &WEBSITE WORKSHOP DESCRIPTION &NAME expressions ( &NAME ) include a large range of linguistic phenomenon , such as phrasal verbs ( e.g. \' add up \' ) , nominal compounds ( e.g. \' telephone box \' ) , and institutionalized phrases ( e.g. \' salt and &NAME \' ) , and they can be syntactically and / or semantically idiosyncratic in nature . &NAME are used frequently in everyday language , usually to express precisely ideas and concepts that cannot be compressed into a single word . A considerable amount of research has been devoted to this subject , both in terms of theory and practice , but despite increasing interest in idiomaticity within linguistic research , there is still a gap between the needs of &NAME and the descriptive tradition of linguistics . Owing to the lack of adequate resources to identify and treat &NAME properly , they pose a real challenge for &NAME . Most real-world applications tend to ignore &NAME or address them simply by listing . However , it is clear that successful applications will need to be able to identify and treat them appropriately . This particularly applies to the many applications which require some degree of semantic processing ( e.g. machine translation , question-answering , summarisation , generation ) . In recent years there has been a growing awareness in the &NAME community of the problems that &NAME pose and the need for their robust handling . A considerable amount of research has been conducted in this area , some within large research projects dedicated to &NAME ( e.g. the &NAME Expression Project ) . There is also a growing interest in &NAME in projects focused on tasks such as parsing ( e.g. Robust Accurate &NAME &NAME ( &NAME ) ) and word sense disambiguation ( e.g. MEANING - &NAME &NAME &NAME Language Technologies ) which are required by real-world applications . Previous workshops on &NAME have focused on certain &NAME types , notably collocations , terminology and named entities . There are , however , further subtypes of &NAME , which are highly relevant for &NAME tasks but which have not to date received specific attention . &NUM example are lexicalised ( non- or semi-compositional ) &NAME which raise specific issues for applications which require semantic interpretation . TARGET AUDIENCE This workshop is intended to bring together &NAME researchers working on all areas of &NAME . The objective is to summarise what has been achieved in the area , to establish common themes between different approaches , and to discuss future trends , with particular emphasis on addressing the problems that different &NAME ( sub ) types pose for real-world &NAME applications . AREAS OF INTEREST Papers are invited on , but not limited to , the following topics : * Theoretical research on &NAME * &NAME taxonomies , classifications and databases * Corpus based analysis of &NAME * Cross-lingual analysis of &NAME types , use , and behaviour * Methods for identification and extraction of &NAME ( machine learning , statistical , example- or rule-based , or hybrid ) * Evaluation of &NAME extraction methods * Integration of &NAME data into grammars and &NAME applications ( e.g. machine translation and generation ) * &NAME &NAME ( or &NAME types ) pose for &NAME applications and solutions proposed Papers can cover &NUM or more of these areas .

To do so , we seek to distil the critical elements of natural evolution and apply these principles to our own ends . Having examined the developmental literature , we hypothesise that evolution acts incrementally and compositionally to construct systems consisting of hierarchical autonomous resonant primitives ( &NAME ) . This is \' what \' is developed . \' How \' these HARPs are developed is a related but distinct question which we then address . Evidence is presented from evolutionary computation , developmental neuroscience , and complex systems research to support the validity of this re-formulation . The existence of &NAME has been alluded to in &NAME \'s \' nearly-decomposable systems \' , in work on the evolution of modularity and in recent work subsumed under the term \' dynamical hierarchies \' . We hypothesise that degeneracy , canalization , and biological complexity exist as a consequence of the existence of HARPs . We hypothesise that HARPs can be utilized to help solve the competing conventions problem so facilitating effective recombination . We hypothesise that HARPs underlie the massive ontogenic re-organizability seen in nervous systems , in genomes themselves , and indeed in any biological system and so confers ontogenic robustness which facilitates increased evolvability . Evolutionary approaches to neural network design have rarely utilized HARPs , and this review seeks to demonstrate their existence and sets the background for a research program to investigate them . &NAME &NAME ) ) &NAME and Adaptive Systems Group ( ( ) ) &NAME , &NAME of &NAME , &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME ( ( &EMAIL ) ) &WEBSITE ', LEGI

Call for Papers : Journal of &NAME &NAME Special Issue on WORD SENSE DISAMBIGUATION &NAME editors : &NAME &NAME , &NAME University , &EMAIL &NAME &NAME , University of &NAME , &EMAIL The process of automatically determining the meanings of words , word sense disambiguation ( &NAME ) , is an important stage in language understanding . It has been shown to be useful for many natural language processing applications including machine translation , information retrieval ( mono- and cross-lingual ) , corpus analysis , summarization and document navigation . The usefulness of &NAME has been acknowledged since the 1950\'s and the field has recently enjoyed a resurgence of interest including the creation of &NAME , an evaluation exercise allowing a basic precision / recall comparison of participating systems , which has been run twice to date . The current availability of large corpora and powerful computing resources has made the exploration of machine learning and statistical methods possible . This is in contrast to the majority of early approaches which relied on hand-crafted disambiguation rules . This special issue of &NAME &NAME , due for publication in &NUM , is intended to describe the current state of the art in word sense disambiguation . Papers are invited on all aspects of &NAME research , and especially on : * Combinations of methods and knowledge sources . Which methods or knowledge sources complement each other and which provide similar disambiguation information ? How should they be combined ? Do better disambiguation results justify the extra cost of producing systems which combine multiple techniques or use multiple knowledge sources ? Can any method or knowledge source be determined to be better or worse than another ? * Evaluation of &NAME systems . Which metrics are most informative and would new &NUM be useful ? Can &NAME be evaluated in terms of the effect it has on another language processing task , for example parsing ? Can evaluations using different data sets ( corpora and lexical resources ) be compared ? Can the cost of producing evaluation data be reduced through the use of automatic methods ? * Sense distinctions and sense inventories . How do these affect &NAME ? How does the granularity of the lexicon affect the difficulty of the &NAME task ? Are some types of sense distinction difficult to distinguish in text ? What can be gained from combining sense inventories and how can this be done ? * The effect of &NAME on applications . To what extent does &NAME help applications such as machine translation or text retrieval ? What kind of disambiguation is most useful for these applications ? What is the effect when the disambiguation algorithm makes mistakes ? * Minimising the need for hand-tagged data . Hand-tagged text is expensive and difficult to obtain while un-tagged text is plentiful and , effectively , limitless . What techniques can be used to make use of un-tagged text , would weakly / semi-supervised learning algorithms be useful ? What use can be made of parallel text ? Can un-tagged text be made as useful as disambiguated text ? Submission Information &NAME &NAME &NAME : &NUM October &NUM All submissions will be subject to the normal peer review process for this journal .

ac.uk, 'Re : [ &NAME ] statistical named entity recognition ', 'Hey &NAME , I guess you looked at the website right ? Making the corpus ( body of email data ) available to the academic community means just that ! The idea is that the anonymisation procedure removes any references to real people / places / organisations / locations etc. and then the corpus is used as a benchmark training and testing resource for academics doing research into the junk email classification problem . That means that they will use computers to generate statistical probabilities of certain words appearing at certain places in emails , and then use these to classify new emails as either genuine or junk . Having a corpus that multiple people test systems on is vital for reproducibility of experiments , etc. Do n\'t worry - noone as seen any of the emails you let me use . ( Obviously I did n\'t use any of the &NUM from &NAME , etc. anyway ! ) The idea of the website is to convince people that it is safe to use the emails they donated as part of this corpus because it will be impossible to tell where the emails came from , where they were sent to , who they were about , etc. etc. But this will only happen with explicit permission from the donor , and if you \'re not happy about yours being used in that way , then that \'s fine !

Optimal ways to combine statistical and symbolic models also vary , depending on applications and tasks . Is it possible to - maximize use of knowledge-rich resources ( e.g. lexicons , NE grammars , parsing ) while permitting corpus-based training for domain or language ? - acquire and share resources ( including lexicons and grammars ) across languages ? - balance performance speed with reasonable accuracy ? - use specific language patterns while permitting rapid transfer to another language ? - minimize variability in results across language types ? We welcome research on combined models , in which these tradeoffs are calculated in particular ways . We hope that the workshop will bring together work on robust and deep multilingual and mixed language NE recognition from different perspectives . Possible topics include - the role of the lexicon vs. dynamic processing information - grammars and lexicons shared ( or ported ) across languages -acquisition of multilingual resources ( e.g. from corpora ) -translating NEs across multiple languages - domain tuning Papers may cover &NUM or more of these ( or related ) areas .

ac.uk, '', 'For the attention of the library committee : There has been a request at the SSCOM for out-of-hours access to the library by students . The initial request is believed to be from Diploma students , but there is a feeling that this is likely to be the thin end of the wedge . In order to guide the library committee in deciding the policy , I have been asked by the &NAME to write a note about the technical and administrative issues involved . Access control to the &NAME and major areas within it is controlled by electronic locks operated by cards . There are &NUM types of cards and associated reader : - The \' &NAME \' cards read by proximity readers - The University card , read by &NAME \' swipe \' readers At present , students on taught courses other than the &NAME are NOT issued with &NAME cards ; they only have University cards . Just &NUM doors are fitted with &NAME readers alongside the &NAME readers : student entrance , &NUM door to &NAME , and &NUM door to the west terrace . Therefore as things stand we cannot straightforwardly offer card access to the library for &NAME and Diploma students . Possible solutions if we wish to do so are : &NUM Extend the \' unlocked \' hours . All of the electronic doors can be put on a time schedule , which can be quite complex . It is quite straightforward to extend the hours that the doors are unlocked , giving access to anybody who can get into the building . This could in principle be combined with paying somebody to supervise the library . &NUM Equip the &NUM doors on the route to the library with &NAME readers . This will have a capital cost ( it needs more than just the reader ) and it may be difficult to conceal the new wiring in the existing walls neatly . It will also take time to organise . &NUM &NAME all students with &NAME cards , which would allow us fine-grained control over the access each could have . Although superficially attractive , it is precisely what we wanted to avoid when we took the decision to install &NAME support alongside &NAME . There would be some cost in supplying the physical cards , but this is small in comparison with the administrative burden of issuing cards , handling lost cards etc. The Continuum system is such that the card handling procedures have not been as easy to automate as we had hoped , and a significant amount of Computer Officer time is required to deal with them . &NUM As &NUM , but restrict the card issue to individuals who make a good case for it - a \' sticky door \' policy . This is predicated on the assumption that relatively few students are likely to wish to use the library out of hours in practice . The danger is that many would apply \' just in case \' , or in the mistaken belief that the card would give access to the rest of the building . We could consider discouraging this by charging a deposit , but it might be hard to justify this being more than the replacement value of the card - under &pound; &NUM - a relatively trivial sum .

In many cases , the only way to access such documents is through blunt instruments such as keyword-based document retrieval . In recent years , there has been significant research ( and considerable commercial interest ) in technologies for automatically extracting and mining useful structured knowledge from unstructured text . Current trends suggest a movement away from pure natural language processing approaches requiring the manual development of rules , to a shallower , less knowledge intensive techniques based on techniques from machine learning , information retrieval and data mining . Adaptive text extraction and mining is an enabling technology with a wide variety of applications . On the Web , automated knowledge capture from text would open the way for both better retrieval , and advanced business applications ( e.g. B2B / B2C applications mediated by knowledge-aware agents ) . For knowledge management , capturing the knowledge contained in a companys repositories would encourage knowledge to be shares and reused among employees , improving efficiency and competitiveness . Extracting information from texts is an important step in capturing knowledge , e.g. for populating databases or ontologies , supporting document &NAME ( e.g. for the Semantic Web ) , for learning ontologies , etc. THE WORKSHOP The workshop will bring together researchers and practitioners from different communities ( e.g. machine learning , text mining , natural language processing , information extraction , information retrieval , ontology learning ) to discuss recent results and trends in mining texts for knowledge capture . Members of other communities ( e.g. information integration and data mining ) could find the workshop very interesting as well . Previous workshops on the use of machine learning for information extraction were held at &ORG-1998 , ECAI-2000 , and IJCAI-2001 .

The original goal was to develop a portable translation system for German and English for the domains of appointment scheduling and travel planning . Later , translation between German and Japanese was added and both a telephone translation system and a remote maintenance system for &NAME were developed . This book contains &NUM articles , grouped into &NUM sections , which address various aspects of the &NAME project . The title is somewhat misleading , as the phrase \' foundations of speech-to-speech translation \' seems to imply that the book will be instructive with respect to the task , or at least contain comprehensive high-level discussion about it . Instead , most articles of the book report on specific components and approaches developed and utilized to support speech-to-speech translation in &NAME . This is fine , but readers should be aware that the book is in no way a textbook ; background knowledge relevant to the individual topics is assumed by the authors of most articles . Having said this , if the term \' foundations \' is taken to mean consideration of all the various kinds of data , components , techniques , etc. that could take part in performing the task , then the articles of the book certainly cover the ground extensively . The articles themselves vary in their focus and emphasis . The stated goals of &NAME were essentially oriented toward producing an end application , and this course provided an excellent setting for a considerable amount of research to be done . Thus , some articles could be roughly characterized as \' here is how we made it work \' , while others could be captioned as \' here is this interesting thing we did within the scope of the project \' . As such , there is material of interest for both academically and commercially oriented readers . Throughout the book , there is a strong emphasis on producing modules that can perform their computations in real-time , and with such a large number of different technologies applied in &NAME , this should be of interest to those interested in developing various kinds of practical &NAME systems . With all the different topics covered , much more high level discussion of how the various bits and modules fit together would have been very welcome , including ( even brief ) overviews of the different sections explaining , basically , what the different articles are about and why they are there . Such overviews also could have provided a forum for more meta-level discussion on how well the different approaches and strategies worked out . It would also have been useful to have a map of the system with pointers to the articles where the relevant modules are discussed ; it is sometimes hard to tell what depended on what from just reading the articles , and it is often necessary to cross-reference several articles to properly situate them within the context of the overall system . The articles are too numerous and diverse in specialization to comment on each one individually in a short review by &NUM reviewer ; however , I will try to give an overall sense of the book \'s contents in the remainder of this review . The first section contains &NUM articles that provide an overview of the completed &NAME system and facts and figures about the project itself . The overview is quite useful for getting a feeling for the system as a whole before launching into the articles on the specifics . It provides very high-level descriptions of some of the various components and how they fit together , as well as general discussion regarding the scope of the task which was undertaken , the data collection effort , and software architecture . It concludes by summarizing some of the lessons learned over the course of the project ; unfortunately , only &NUM pages are devoted to this , when in fact it seems that it would be worthy of its own chapter . Also , the overview clearly stays focused on the successes of &NAME , whereas it would be very beneficial for the reader , whether research or application oriented , to also hear about the problems that were encountered and the things that did not go so well . The next section contains &NUM articles that deal with topics in processing spoken input , with all its messy details , and transforming it into representations that can be processed by the syntax , semantics , and translation components . The first half of the section is concerned with the methodologies and techniques for speech recognition , covering topics such as language identification , providing robustness in the face of various noise conditions , optimizations for improving the efficiency of speech recognition components , and investigations into new techniques for capturing long range dependencies in language modeling . The latter articles report on the creation of pronunciation dictionaries from data to provide variants for canonical pronunciations , the &NAME and classification of prosodic information , detection of emotional behavior by users , and the detection and correction of speech repairs as a filter process between recognition and subsequent processing stages . The third section is the largest -- it includes &NUM articles addressing lexical and syntactic processing . &NUM different approaches to parsing were developed and integrated : a robust chunk parser built from a cascade of finite state transducers , a probabilistic &NAME parser , and an optimized &NAME &NAME &NAME Grammar ( &NAME ) parser . These approaches , which are each discussed in separate articles , provided the means to balance robustness with accuracy and depth of syntactic analysis . There is also a further , brief article describing how their results were combined . While the &NAME parser provides full semantic analyses , the chunk parser and &NAME parser produce only syntactic trees ; how interpretations are read from these trees is discussed in an article on semantic construction . The use of a &NAME syntactic framework such as &NAME required considerable justification in the face of the cost of developing grammars and efficient parsing techniques , the third section contains an article that lays out some of the arguments for using &NAME over other available frameworks and answers some of the concerns regarding the efficiency and complexity of having deep analysis as such at all . &NUM further articles describe aspects of the &NAME grammars which were developed for German , English , and Japanese . Since the results of the &NUM parsers need to be integrated into a single interpretation for further processing , it was necessary to develop a standard interface representation that abstracted from the particularities of each of the approaches . For this , &NAME &NAME Terms ( &NAME ) were developed and employed , and are motivated and described in detail in the fourth article in this section . &NAME provide an underspecified , flat representation that permits many different kinds of information about an utterance to be stored and accessed , including basic predications , scope constraints , sorts , discourse relations , syntactic features , tense and aspect , and prosody . The final article of this section describes the multilingual lexical databases that were developed and highlights some of the issues in dealing with the morphology of the different languages and ensuring that it was possible to retrieve translation equivalents from &NUM language to the other for the semantic transfer translation component . There are &NUM articles on aspects of semantic processing in the fourth section . The first discusses how the analyses produced by the &NUM different parsers were combined to produce a single semantic output , and the second deals with processing the intermediate &NAME hypotheses of the parsers in robust manner that corrects certain recognition errors and disfluencies in the semantic output of each parser . The next paper focuses on how some of the non-local ambiguities in &NAME were resolved by incorporating discourse and prosodic information . The rule-based module employed for this handled aspects such as verb and adverb disambiguation , anaphora and ellipsis resolution , and focus projection . The final article in this section relates how the semantic databases were designed to support multiple languages and ensure that they map material in a given source language to comparable semantic relations in &NAME to assist in semantic transfer translation . In the fifth section , we come to descriptions of the actual translation engines employed in &NAME . &NUM main approaches were explored : semantic transfer , statistical translation , substring-based translation , case-based translation , and dialog-act based translation . The different engines tackled the problem in significantly different ways that gave them , in some cases , complementary strengths and weaknesses . Echoing the multi-engine approach to parsing discussed earlier , the translations ultimately produced by the &NAME system were chosen from those created by these different modules , based on the confidence values they assigned to their outputs . The sixth section contains &NUM articles which address the recognition , representation and use of discourse information within the system . The first article explicates the representation of dialog , including illocutionary force , propositional content , and temporal expressions , and the following article discusses how dialog structures are produced for the purposes of both context-sensitive translation and producing multilingual summaries of the dialogs mediated by &NAME . The final article describes the module which performs contextual disambiguation using the variety of sources of information built up during the \' deep processing \' path in &NAME and which plays a role in semantic transfer translation . The seventh section deals with sentence realization and speech synthesis . First to be discussed is the &NAME generation component , which takes the &NAME output by the semantic transfer translation module and determines how they should be expressed . After a &NAME is fully specified , it is handed to &NUM syntactic realization components , one which uses &NAME Grammar ( &NAME ) and another which uses &NAME . The grammars for the former realizer are compiled from the English and Japanese &NAME grammars discussed earlier ; the HPSG-to-TAG compilation process is the subject of the second article in this section . The next article deals with the creation of dialog minutes and summaries , a useful task which crucially relies on the dialog processing component described in the previous section and the generation component covered in this one . The final article discusses the concept-to-speech synthesis component used for producing the final spoken output of the system . The articles in the eighth section describe various aspects of the data collection and corpus creation efforts and evaluation and analysis of different components of &NAME . These include information about recording , transcription , treebanking , and analysis of the data utilized to develop the &NAME system . &NUM articles provide evaluations of the speech recognition and synthesis components and the quality of the different translation paths . These evaluations were carried out at different sites from those which produced the modules , which was certainly of particular importance for the translation evaluation which involved &NUM competing approaches . There is a further article on a module which attempts to select the best output from one of the translation modules based on the confidence values they produce ; this article might have been better situated in the fourth section of the book , especially since it provides some higher level discussion of the different translation approaches . Finally , the &NUM articles in the ninth section deal with concerns of software architecture and integration . Since &NAME involved &NUM research groups with scientists and programmers with varying competencies with respect to programming skills and knowledge of software engineering , it was no small task to coordinate the components that were produced at the individual sites and enable them to work together as a whole . A special group was devoted to this task , and the article on their effort provides an informative look at the technical ( and sociological ) issues which were overcome in this integration . The other article describes how &NAME was extended to provide telephone translation services . &NAME tackled all sorts of problems on all sorts of fronts , resulting in an impressive and extensive body of work that led to &NUM scientific publications and &NUM spin-off products . The project \'s funding and activities provided an immense boost for computational linguistics research and development in &NAME . This book provides significant insight into the project , and it will be useful to researchers and commercial developers who are interested in specific aspects of speech-to-speech translation and how they fit within the context of an overall system for translation . The articles are so diverse that it is hard to imagine any single person reading all of the articles contained in the collection since only a subset of them are likely to be of particular interest to any given reader ; nonetheless , it will certainly be an excellent resource for anyone who is specifically interested in &NAME itself and can use it to quickly find information on all the modules in &NUM big handy volume .

It was unanimously agreed that the Syndicate did not favour the introduct ion of the &NAME . &NUM &NAME of &NAME Notes The Teaching Committee has requested clarification on the issue of copyri ght of lecture notes . The Council \'s opening statement at the Discussion on Intellectual Prope rty Rights contained the following : &NAME Council wish to put on the record that their intention is not to a ssert ownership of copyright in lecture notes or books except where explicitly agreed as part of a commissioning process , for example as might occur for the creation of material for e-learning.94 The Head of Department interpreted this to mean that the authors of mater ial which is explicitly commissioned would have to agree to the commissioning and the transfer of copyright . As far as he was aware , no such commissioned material for teaching under the Syndicate \'s jurisdiction had been produ ced . It was his belief that if the Syndicate felt that there was a case for material to be commissioned , for example for an e-learning course , then he would consult the Department before proceeding . He suggested that \' license to use \' rather than copyright transfer would then be a more appropriate approach . Following further discussion , Professor &NAME reiterated that the position was clear : copyright remained firmly in the hands of the author . &NUM Calculators for use in &NAME The currently approved calculator had been discontinued and its replacement had features that were a cause of concern to the Board of Examinations . The Teaching Committee had considered the matter and the Syndicate accepted their recommendation that they would accept any calculator that satisfies the various Natural Science and Engineering committees . &NUM Membership of the Degree Committee Dr &NAME \'s impending promotion to Professor entitled him to serve ex officio on the Degree Committee thus creating a vacancy for &CHAR co-opted member . The &NAME concurred with &NAME &NAME \'s proposal to co-opt Dr &NAME &NAME , the Chairman of the &NAME &NAME Committee , for &NUM year from &NUM January to &NUM December &NUM . &ORG also concurred with &NAME &NAME \'s proposal to co-opt Dr &NAME &NAME to the Committee in her role as Chairman of the Examiners for the &NAME . &NUM Any other business None . &NUM Date of the next meeting Tuesday &NUM January &NUM at &NUM in the &ORG .

The toolkit allows rapid development of advanced text management applications such as text classification , summarisation , mining and querying . It is uniquely capable of supporting the next generation of such systems , which go beyond pure term indexing or domain-specific entity extraction . The &NAME toolkit is a package of text processing modules which annotate text with linguistic information concerning the entities referred to , properties predicated of these relations , and relations which hold between them . For instance , the following text sentence-from the transcript of President &NAME \'s speech at the &NAME Museum Center on 7th October , &NUM -- is analysed into sets of entities and relations between them some of which are shown underneath : Members of the &NAME of both political parties , and members of &ORG &ORG , agree that &NAME &NAME is a threat to peace and must disarm . Entities : [ Member+s of the &NAME of both political parties ] [ Member+s ] [ the &NAME ] [ both political parties ] [ political parties ] [ parties ] [ &NAME &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ &NAME ] [ &ORG &ORG ] [ &ORG ] [ the &ORG ] [ the Council ] Relations : [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] be / is [ a threat ] ] [ the &NAME ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] [ the Council ] agree+s [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] The actual output of the system further decomposes and classifies these relations and there are other output formats ( href ) Term-based systems represent text documents as \' bags of words \' ( i.e. sets of characters between white spaces ) but will not directly recover the entities referred to in a document , such as \' &NAME &NAME \' , \' political parties \' , \' &ORG &ORG \' or \' members of &NAME of both political parties \' . Representing entities rather than terms supports more powerful and precise information management because it provides a better basis for cross indexing variants both within and across documents , such as \' the &NAME &NAME Council \' or \' the &ORG \' , and thus also a better way of classifying , summarising or querying document content via salient entities . The &NAME system recovers noun phrases referring to entities and classifies them in a domain-independent way into names ( subdivided into places , people , organisations ) , numbers ( including ranges , dates , etc ) , measure phrases ( ounce , year , etc ) , temporal expressions ( days , weeks , months ) , directions ( north , south , etc ) , and so forth . Relational representation of entities provides a natural and effective mechanism for cross-indexing alternate descriptions of entities via subsets of relations ( href ) . Extant systems for extracting entities from text , based on deterministic finite-state pattern matching , rely heavily on manually-supplied domain-specific lexical information from the outset . The relational information recovered by the &NAME system can be used to index \' who did what to whom \' and supports precise querying about the properties predicated of specific entities across a document collection . A relational pattern like \' [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] agree [ ? ] \' ( \' What does the &NAME &NAME Council agree ? \' ) can be matched intelligently against document annotations yielding precise , specific and small amounts of focussed information . This approach to information retrieval deals naturally with non-contiguous text sequences mapping to the same underlying entity or relation ( [ the &ORG ] [ the &NAME &NAME Council ] ) as well as other well known problems with pure term or entity based systems , such as negation ( [ the Council ] [ not agree ] [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] $ neq $ [ the Council ] agree [ [ &NAME ] [ must disarm ] ] ) . The &NAME toolkit achieves about &NUM accuracy recovering entities and relations from arbitrary English texts , without making use of domain-specific lexical information . It has been used to date to analyse about &NUM million words of English . A recent paper from a refereed conference proceedings gives more details about each module of the toolkit and compares performance to related systems . &NAME and performance for specific applications can be considerably improved by semi-automatic customisation on domain and / or application specific text . The toolkit is fully compatible with existing &NAME standards for text &NAME up and can be used to leverage web sites which will conform with emerging standards for the semantic web ( &NAME / &NAME href ) . A non-exclusive commercial licence to use the &NAME toolkit , which includes &NUM hours support and consultancy to assist with customising and integrating the toolkit into the client \'s application , costs $ pounds $ &NUM , &NUM . The toolkit is available free for non-commercial use including prototyping and proof-of-concept work in industry . Support for this and / or general consultancy on &NAME / IR applications and systems is available from &NAME Ltd at a rate of $ pounds $ &NUM / hour . The cofounders of &NAME are &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME . The &NAME toolkit is the product of collaborative research at the University of &NAME , &NAME Laboratory and University of &NAME , &ORG . &NAME &NAME has sole rights to commercial exploitation of the toolkit and works closely with these academic groups to continuously enhance and improve the performance of the toolkit .

The purpose of this conference is to bring together leading researchers from the evolvable hardware community , representatives of the automated design and programmable / reconfigurable hardware communities , technology developers and end-users from the aerospace , military and commercial sectors . &NAME hardware techniques enable self-reconfigurability , adaptability and learning by programmable devices and thus have the potential to significantly increase the functionality of deployable hardware systems . &NAME &NAME is expected to have major impact on deployable systems for space systems and defense applications that need to survive and perform at optimal functionality during long duration in unknown , harsh and / or changing environments . It is also expected to greatly enhance the capability of systems that need modification , upgrade and learning without interrupting their operation .

com, '&NAME Group &NAME - &NUM January &NUM ', 'This is sent to you by &NAME Group - ------- A STRATEGY FOR &NAME SERVICES MASTER CLASS SERIES -------- &NAME &NAME and &NAME Group \'s Research Director , &NAME &NAME are hosting a new series of Master &NAME on Web Service Strategies throughout &NAME &NAME during &NAME and March &NUM . This Master Class will explore &NUM key aspects of Web services crucial to a successful Web services strategy : The Economics of Web Services ; Web Services and Integration ; Web Services and Business Process Management and a Strategy for Web Services . For more information , or to register to attend any of these events , please visit : &WEBSITE &NAME Group are also hosting &NUM one-day Master &NAME in &NAME . How to Gain Competitive Advantage IT &NAME Master &NAME will be hosted by &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME . For further information , please visit : &WEBSITE Dear &NAME Please find below this week \'s issue of &NAME , written exclusively by &NAME Group Analysts . DISCOVERING A STRATEGY Discovery - whether of information by an individual , or of services by an organisation - is essential for the effective use of the &NAME . The Web is an increasingly tangled morass of data , the vast majority of which is not relevant to specific searches ; nevertheless , search engines are regularly deceived into delivering hits that will waste the time of any searcher . This is annoying for an end-user , but potentially very expensive for a business , which will lose productive employee time to sifting through search results . Ensuring the filtering of information in a dependable manner is therefore a real business opportunity at both the individual and corporate levels , and at present the dominant force in this space is &NAME . THE BIG &NAME &NAME has rapidly risen as a force to be reckoned with in the search field , due to the strength of its algorithms and rapid brand creation , but it is now also positioning itself as a potential rival to the established portal businesses , such as &NAME ! , &NAME , and &NAME \'s &NAME &NAME . These sites have made considerable use of &NAME \'s leading search technology , which is increasingly placing them in potentially awkward positions . On the &NUM hand , &NAME searches are regularly driving new visitors to their sites , and indeed &NAME ! has been utilising &NAME search technology since &NUM . On the other , &NAME is adding functionality and features , such as news and shopping capabilities , that undermine some of the core businesses involved in these sites , and its influence is constantly growing . As part of its response to this threat , &NAME ! has recently acquired &NAME , a search company based on technology that failed to compete with &NAME . No announcement has yet been made that &NAME will replace the use of &NAME at &NAME ! , but this is clearly only a matter of timing . On the face of things , this seems an uncertain strategy , as the &NAME search technology is perceived as being inferior to that of &NAME . However , &NAME ! has clearly recognised that in order to protect its long-term interests it must avoid any dependence on third-party search technology , particularly when this is provided by an increasingly competitive business . Much of the real value in the long-term discovery market will be in the fee-based provision of service-oriented searches in the Web services arena , which will attract corporate business . Emerging standards , including the Universal Discovery Description and &NAME ( &NAME ) , and the recently announced WS-Policy , will combine to simplify the process of providing and acquiring business services on-line . However , these initiatives will not initially serve the needs of many smaller companies , which will lack the developmental resources required to utilise them ; this leaves a vast discovery market that the leading brand portals will be able to enter as providers of service . &NAME GROUP OPINION:- The search industry has consolidated very rapidly in recent years , and &NAME is the clear winner at the individual user level . If the portals are to succeed in preventing their core businesses from being leeched away by the expansion of &NAME into new territories , they must begin to make more decisive moves to position themselves as credible service providers in the discovery space ; if this is to be done successfully , it will require investments in both technology and brand creation . The portals must position themselves as discovery service providers now , which will require investments in search technology such as that made by &NAME ! , or they may find that &NAME will dominate that market as well . MAKING DATA QUALITY COUNT It does n\'t matter how efficiently a company \'s &NAME , or &NAME solutions are able to group and segment customers and their data to support the latest marketing campaign or promotional mail shot . If the source data itself is of a poor quality , then the information extracted may already have been compromised . When you also consider the high levels of project failure reported within customer facing IT sectors , it should be seen as a fundamental issue to ensure that data quality and accuracy is made a prime consideration . THE BIG &NAME Many enterprise level organisations keep commercial information about their customers , and the products and services that they provide across a number of data stores . Sometimes this may cause an inability to correctly identify customers , or alternatively to identify the same customers more than once . All of which can cause important customers to receive incorrectly addressed , duplicate , or inappropriate information . The results being , possible lost sales opportunities , money wasted on capturing and maintaining useless or duplicate records , and probably most importantly from a corporate perspective , presenting an image to the outside world of inefficiency . There are also other issues to be considered , perhaps fraud prevention may be an important area , especially to those delivering services in the financial sectors , or the prevention of money laundering could be a key issue . In each case the quality of the source data is important , and lack of data quality can lead to undesirable activities being hidden . Holding and maintaining records on a database , whether customer , product , or other record types has a measurable cost both in terms of storage , maintenance , and support activities . Therefore , the value that can be derived from deploying a good quality data cleansing tool can be measured in a number of ways including : reduced staff costs in the customer support and systems maintenance areas , reduced mailing costs by ensuring that offers made are correctly targeted and individual customer duplications are removed , and increased sales revenue through having the ability to accurately identify cross-selling and up-selling opportunities . &NAME GROUP &NAME Very few vendors working in the mainstream &NAME , &NAME , and &NAME arenas would argue against the fact that data quality , or lack thereof , is one of the main issues when attempting to deliver effective business solutions . Our view would be that there are at least &NUM major areas of concern to be considered when looking at improving data quality within an organisation . Firstly , there is the initial issue of data cleansing , which often in the past has focused on one-shot attempts to clean up customer and associated data with a specific goal in mind . Secondly , and an issue for any organisation that is serious about the quality of data that it continues to maintain , there is the question of how to permanently maintain data integrity once the initial cleansing exercise has been completed . When selecting a solution to imbed or run alongside mainstream infrastructure systems we would recommend that the selected system should be capable of providing both batch and real-time cleansing facilities especially in environments where data change is dynamic , and especially where customer contact is made on the basis of the organisations in depth knowledge of the customer . SPENDING BEFORE INFORMATION Despite figures that show that only &NUM in &NUM members of the public are accessing Government Web sites , e-tail Web sites would appear to be faring rather better . As is usually the case , the trend has been set in the US with customer sales reaching just under US $ &NUM billion in &NUM , but it appears that the &NAME is now following &NAME , and is in serious catch up mode with on-line shopping growing &NUM times faster in the &NAME than in the US at present . Although consumers still have concerns over the security of e-tail sites , there are advantages to shopping on-line and it would appear that these advantages are at last making a breakthrough . THE BIG &NAME The Government has recently vowed to dedicate more funds to increasing the number of people who access its services on-line . However , it appears that e-tailers hardly have to try . The interactive &ORG ( &NAME ) has found that &NUM million &NAME shoppers bought on-line in November &NUM , spending &NUM billion pounds . This figure is expected to rise to more than &NUM in the next few months according to a &NAME poll carried out on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry ( &NAME ) . The &NUM billion pound figure for November is the biggest ever amount spent on-line in the &NAME , and represents a &NUM rise on October 2002\'s figures and a spectacular &NUM rise on the same period for the previous year . The benefits of buying on-line include time and monetary savings , home delivery of goods , and better consumer rights . These benefits have , however , always been available and do not explain the huge rise in e-tail sales . &NAME has been improved , which may have helped to allay some people \'s concerns , although a survey carried out by &NAME &NAME found that around &NUM of its respondents still felt \' uncomfortable \' giving out their credit card information on-line , and similar percentages were worried about the security of on-line financial transactions , and on-line privacy in general . The rise in broadband take-up is also thought to be partly responsible for the rise in e-tail sales , with its ability to make browsing and accessing e-tail sites even faster . e-tailers in the &NAME have been found to be better at converting browsers into customers . Nielsen//Net Ratings found that of the &NUM large developed economies they surveyed , the &NAME converted the most browsers into paying customers . Other research by &NAME also revealed that more people would be prepared to shop on-line if there were better guarantees about issues such as security and the quality of merchandise . The &NAME Government is helping to promote on-line buying by , for example , publishing examples of people who have benefited by making purchases on-line and generally promoting the on-line message . &NAME GROUP &NAME Ease of use issues are important where both Government and e-tail Web sites are concerned , but at the end of the day shopping i.e. spending money on things you want or need , especially from the comfort of your own home , is far more attractive than finding out information mostly concerning the payment of bills , or mundane issues such as rubbish collection . It may also be a case of preference and tradition . People often wish to hear a real person tell them local government type information or to deal with a complaint , but are quite happy to shop alone . &NAME e-tail sites are adept at attracting browsers and enticing them to part with their cash and can be secure in the knowledge that improvements to security will result in increased numbers of on-line consumers . OUTLOOK WINTRY ( FOR &NAME \'S IT STAFF ) &NUM saw IT jobs continuing to be axed by employers in the &NAME . Reductions in end-users \' IT spending reined in the requirement for development and integration expertise from consultancies , as well as causing the loss of jobs amongst in-house IT staff . IT budgets are likely to be severely limited in &NUM , with forecast growth as low as &NUM . THE BIG &NAME Looking back only a few years , many factors combined to produce a boom in &NAME IT employment that will almost certainly never be repeated . The recession of the early 1990\'s left businesses and the public sector with a backlog of change requirements , and facing a looming deadline to do something to address the &NAME issue . These circumstances saw many embark on the wholesale replacement of enterprise systems , by customised redevelopment or more commonly by the procurement of package solutions , both of which were readily supplied by a hungry and helpful IT industry . &NAME of utilities , and the rapid growth of the mobile telecommunications industry were also significant drivers of IT spending . After the millennium , and the loss of confidence in dot-anything there has seemed an uncertainty about how to deploy IT budget to best advantage . The Government \'s determined spending is a sole exception , perhaps unfettered by such considerations . Organisations \' current IT spending plans reveal the priorities for the near future to be asset protection and consolidation . Such investment as there is will be aimed towards security , &NAME ( to derive value from existing data ) , content management ( with the same objective ) , or application integration ( to enhance value from legacy systems and other existing software ) . Like an increasing proportion of business requirements , these will be addressed with maximum use of packaged solutions in order to hasten implementation and Return On &NAME ( &NAME ) . &NAME has proved attractive to many companies , enabling them to reduce staff numbers and stabilise or reduce spending on IT . The service provider to whom in-house IT staff have been transferred use the human resources flexibly , according to which of its customers need bodies from the pool of expertise , achieving more efficient and dynamic deployment of staff . Overall , the number of IT resources required is reduced . Indeed , the outsourcing providers themselves increasingly consolidate and merge , gaining further efficiency via reduction in numbers of consultants . &NAME GROUP &NAME Advice for those hoping to thrive or perhaps even survive at a time of so much aggregation must be to work with a significant market player . Skills in greatest demand change constantly , but nevertheless must be kept up to date - understanding what is shaping the employment market place is the best guide to what skills will be needed ( &NAME Group \'s analysis is an invaluable aid ) . Ominously for some , offshore service providers have already provided cost-efficient expert resource , and are likely to build on their success by competing more directly in the &NAME market . &NAME Group has built a considerable reputation , not only for the quality of its technical research , but also for the ability to relate complex technical issues to the needs of business .

COGENT : Controlled Generation of &NAME \' , Natural Language Generation ( &NAME ) technology has reached a level of maturity where applied systems exist in a range of specialised real-world domains ( such as weather bulletins , software documentation , health and legal advice and stock market movements ) . However , developing such systems currently involves hand-crafting and special-purpose tuning by &NAME experts which is non-portable , non-scaleable , time-consuming and expensive . Wider deployment of language generation requires more generally applicable and reusable &NAME components based on wide-coverage grammars ; however , at present effective techniques for such wide-coverage generation are not well understood . The COGENT project will investigate systematically the characteristics of wide-coverage generation and to develop techniques for controlling it effectively . As well as furthering our understanding of wide-coverage generation , the project aims to deliver a substantial and novel resource to support future research in this area , and practical implementations of wide-coverage controllable generators . The project is in collaboration with &NAME , University of &NAME . Natural Language Service Composition The pervasive computing environment of the future will provide a wide variety of services within the network . The value of such services will be greatly enhanced if we are able to tailor our computing environment by composing services . For example you might want to arrange for your heating to be turned off when your calendar indicates that you will be out of your house for more than a day . This project investigates how &NAME techniques can help make service composition a possibility for non-technical users . Services , such as heating systems and personal calendars , advertise themselves to a service directory that will develop an ontology of services . This can be exploited to constrain the discourse domain in which users describe new features . The interface will guide the user to an unambiguous expression of the new feature that can be mapped onto a standard component architecture of services . These studentships would be suitable for people interested in carrying out research into areas such as * statistical &NAME * applied natural language semantics , * lexical acquisition for practical language processing systems or * the association of linguistic knowledge with ontologies Applicants for these studentships should have a good first degree and / or postgraduate qualification in computer science , computer processing of language , or similar . The studentships covers tuition fees for &NAME nationals ; the projects also pay a ( tax-free ) stipend starting at &NAME &NUM a year .

It is obvious that for the small corpus designer , &NUM million or less tokens , markup is a considerable investment in time . However , if one holds , as I do , that a corpus is not a simple mass of data , but a carefully compiled selection of texts , then we need a means to treat them as texts , to store both their general features and their particularities . This the &NAME does . In my own work in the field of English for Academic Purposes , I tend not to use the corpus header but a standard individual header so as to stock all the bibliographic information and socilinguistic parameters associated with the text . The depth of markup depends on my needs , and time , for an individual text . In this way I can move with ease from a fully annotated single text to a more lightly marked up corpus . This is possible because of the encoding possibilities of the &NAME . Education is very much part of the answer . Easy access to vast amounts of downloadable data has meant that a number of \' corpus &NAME \' neither know nor care about the niceties of corpus creation , and the whys and wherefores of selecting and marking up data . Ease of access has become the main criterion , potentially to the detriment of the discipline itself . Easy solutions do not necessarily answer the most pertinent questions . It is true that all this takes time , but if we throw out all that is time-consuming drudgery from corpus linguistics , we may find that we have thrown out our text baby with the corpus bathwater and are only left with ready-made corpora for ready-made answers .

Can people who are planning on using the bus please email back to me , so that we have some idea of the numbers on the bus Also , as you know there is a &NAME talk at the &NAME on the 22nd April . There will also be a bus running to this talk , leaving &NAME / &NAME at &NUM 40am . ABSTRACT : &NAME is understood in the relationship between the sequence , structure and solubility of a protein . However , it is clear that the function of a protein is intimately related to its solubility , namely that structural proteins are insoluble while enzymes must have a very high solubility . Our inability to predict solubility presents practical difficulties , especially for &NAME &NAME Initiatives as up to &NUM of non-membrane proteins cannot be crystallised due to insolubility of the sample . Furthermore , it seems plausible that the mechanisms responsible for the formation of insoluble amyloid fibrils are similar to those at play in the formation of the random insoluble aggregates that form in inclusion bodies . It is clear that the hydrophobic ( or polar ) content of the surface of a protein plays a key role in its solubility . Given the collective behaviour of water , we hypothesise , that individual surface residues may not necessarily play a decisive role in dictating its solubility but that patches of residues may well do so . To examine this , we construct a score based on the average hydrophobic / polar content of surface patches of atoms ( or residues ) over a set of &NUM monomeric proteins . To see if the resulting distribution of scores is unusal we compare the distribution of scores for each protein with the scores from an equivalent randomised surface . We can also examine the variation of the score for each patch over homologous proteins . Here too we can compare the distribution of scores with scores generated from randomised sequences . In the first case , we find that the atomic patch score , have distributions with shorter tails than those generated from the randomised surfaces indicating that the surface atoms are arranging themselves so as to avoid extrema of hydrophobicity or hydrophilicity . Perhaps more interestingly , in the case of examining the hydrophobic patch score as it varys over sequences , we find that hydrophobic patches tend to be supressed , suggesting that surface residues can evolve in a collective fashion . We argue that this confirms our initial hypothesis , what its consequences are and some future research we can carry out .

Of course , I know that this is only the methodology to do a project . I still have to get a theme . The problem is I know absolutely nothing about the methodology . So I have no idea of what it is capable to do ? Can you suggest some reports of projects done by others for me to read so that I can get some ideas of what I can do ?

My big constraint was that I get most of my mail through &NAME &NAME , which requires an &NAME connection to download mail over the open &NAME . That seemed at first to rule out a lot of spam solutions . The first one I tried was &NAME Inspector , which creates and periodically updates a set of native &ORG filtering rules .

There \'s lots of ways it could be improved on both the usability and machine learning fronts , but it \'s not bad at all and is already making my life much easier . It only trains on those examples you tell it to , and if I recall correctly the documentation encourages you to only train on examples it made a mistake on ( \' conservative training \' in &NAME \'s sense ) . &NAME actually had a paper , with somewhat murky results , on conservative training of naive &NAME classifiers : @inproceedings { &NAME , author \' &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME \' , title \' An Apobayesian Relative of &NAME \' , booktitle \' Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems &NUM \' , year &NUM , pages \' &NUM \' , editor &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME \' , publisher &NAME &NAME \' , address &NAME &NAME \' It would be interesting to know more about how well naive &NAME does with conservative training . &NAME p.s.

ohio, 'Re : [ &NAME ] Corpus Sanitation ', 'Another comment on anonymisation . The problem is even worse if one wishes to make available ( for whatever purpose ) the audio or video tapes from which transcriptions have been prepared . I believe that considering this more challenging case also clarifies issues for text-only corpora . I \'ll assume video , which is the extreme point . There are &NUM problems with video . No amount of signal manipulation however small , preserves the full scientific usefulness of the data . On the other hand , no reasonable amount of \' anonymisation \' , however large , really ensures anonymity . The first point is obvious if one contemplates trying to do psycholinguistic experiments with the data . It would for example seriously compromise a comprehension study if proper names are bleeped out , or even replaced by others . No psychology reviewer would ever accept that such data is as naturalistic as untreated data . The second point is almost as obvious , because humans are adept at inferring personal identity from all kinds of things , including voice quality , ear shape , gait and so on . Therefore , whatever &NUM does , short of blanking everything out , it is difficult to credibly claim that the risk of unintended identification has been avoided . &NAME &NAME \'s &NAME documentation makes the case that such identification is highly undesirable . The only way I can see to handle this is to deal with the problem at the outset by making completely clear to participants what will happen to their data , and obtaining informed consent . If this is not done , the data is effectively lost to responsible researchers , and cannot be used except at risk of infringing participants rights . If , as in the case &NAME has , promises have been made to participants , those promises must be honoured . It may or may not be possible to recover data that is both useful and distributable under these circumstances . The same difficulties are also present for audio ( the &NAME audio has never been distributed , even though it exists ) . The risk of identification is just too great and the consequences of that too severe to be acceptable . Although the visual cues to identity are absent , speaking style persists . One may feel that the risks are less , but they still exist . And , here \'s the rub , the same arguments apply , albeit more weakly , to text-only corpora . While voice quality is now absent , substantial cues to personal identity may persist in lexis and other idiosyncrasies , not to mention that people are extremely adept at reconstructing material from context . Once again , the risks are arguably less than in the other media , but they still exist . So , notwithstanding valiant efforts to anonymise in such a way that the scientific usefulness of the data is preserved , the original decision to promise anonymity comes back to haunt us . I lean to the view that there is no difference of principle between the different media . Is even &NAME \'s rigorous approach to anonymization enough in practice ? Perhaps , but that depends on a very iffy judgement call . The lesson seems to be that great care is needed in collecting informed consent for corpus work . None of this addresses the additional point made in &NAME \'s post about collateral damage to people and organisations not involved in the recording . I could imagine a prosecution against both participants and corpus distributors for defamation or slander . That would be bad . Perhaps corpus collectors need to indemnify participants against this , or perhaps it suffices to warn people that they are ( in effect ) speaking in a public place . Or perhaps we have a duty of care to ensure that our participants do not put themselves at risk ( doubly likely since many corpora include contributions by children ) . And that leaves aside the much more likely cases where nasty stuff in the corpus evokes resentment and unhappiness , but not enough to lead to prosecutions . &NAME Dr. &NAME &NAME , Assistant Professor of Computational Linguistics Department of Linguistics , &NUM &NAME Avenue , &NAME OH &NUM &NAME : &NUM &NUM &NUM &NAME : &NUM &NUM &NUM Web : &WEBSITE ', LEGI

ac.uk, '', 'sorry meant to send this . It \'s my abstract for &NAME . &NAME &NAME - &NAME University &EMAIL &ORG &NAME &NAME Building &NUM &NAME &NAME Avenue &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME A Computational Model for Lexical Acquisition of a Categorial Grammar A model of lexical acquisition has been developed in order to learn both the semantic and syntactic category of lexemes associated with a generalised categorial grammar . Computational simulation shows that acquisition is possible when some prior language knowledge is assumed . The effects on acquisition have been explored when aspects of this prior knowledge are varied . At this conference &CHAR would present the acquisition model , focusing particularly on the novel syntax learner , as well as the results of acquisition experiments that have been run from different starting points in terms of the prior knowledge assumed . In child language acquisition theory it has been suggested that children have an innate ability to recognise the category of particular types of words and this ability in turn helps them to determine the category of other words . Whether this innate ability to categorise applies to \' names and object words \' or \' actions words \' has been much discussed . The difference in acquisition rate in each case is investigated . The method assumes a pipelined approach to acquisition . Each utterance in turn is first processed for the acquisition of semantic information and subsequently for the acquisition of syntactic information . It is assumed that this is compatible with children \'s behaviour . It is likely that children acquire all the information they can from an utterance when they hear it and then discard it . It would be impractical for the child to store many utterances to process later . The syntactic learner relies on output from the semantic learner . This also echos children \'s behaviour since they pass through a single word acquisition phase before they begin to acquire syntax . The semantic learner produces a mapping between words and their semantic representation using , amongst others , the theories of cross-situational learning and covering constraints and is based on &NAME \'s work on &NAME &NAME Techniques . A fundamental assumption is employed to link the &NUM learners ; the number of words that the semantic category of a word is dependent upon is the same as the number of words that the syntactic category is dependent upon . The syntactic learner attempts to create valid parse trees for the categorial grammar thus resolving unknowns in the syntactic category types . This is achieved by first assigning skeleton categories to words in the current utterance - using the fundamental assumption in conjunction with information already extracted by the semantic learner . All possible binary tree structures for the utterance are then considered . &NAME trees are discarded whilst any valid trees add weighting to the syntactic categories of words at their leaf nodes . For a very simple example consider the sentence \' The grinch cries \' . Using the scenario where children have an innate ability to recognise names and objects , we already know that : \' grinch \' is of semantic category &NAME and syntactic category &CHAR , In order to find a skeleton category for the remaining words we look at their semantic category and then apply the fundamental assumption : \' the \' has semantic category THE ( &CHAR ) and syntactic category x|y \' cries \' has semantic category &NAME ( &CHAR ) and syntactic category u|v where | is used to represent either forward or backward application and &CHAR , &CHAR , &CHAR , &CHAR are syntactic categories ( which may be either atomic or complex ) . A possible parse tree for this sentence is : &CHAR ? u|v / \' cries \' x|y &CHAR \' The \' \' &NAME \' The syntax learner could then discover the following unknowns : &CHAR &CHAR sx / \' cries \' &CHAR / &CHAR &CHAR \' The \' \' &NAME \' The input to the system is a collection of utterances paired with semantic representations . These semantic representations are the hypothesised meanings a child may assume for an utterance . The correct interpretation may or may not be included amongst the semantic representations . The affect of this type of noise on the system may also be investigated . Children learn their native tongue because it is the language of their environment . In the early stages of acquisition the only language that children are exposed to is that of their caketakers . This implies that the caretakers \' utterances are the only input needed to begin acquisition . To mirror this situation , from which children actually learn , I use real data ; the interaction between a child and her parents . Since the child involved did successfully learn English , it is reasonable to assume that the utterances the child heard the parents say are sufficient for learning ( provided a capable model and correct starting assumptions can be found ) . The &NAME \'s Corpus of the &NAME database has been used for this work . The corpus contains a selection of interactions between a child and her parents from the age of &NUM year &NUM month to &NUM years and &NUM month . The corpus has been preprocessed by &NAME . All phonological annotations and grammatical structures not covered by her grammar , including interjections and elliptical material , have been removed . The child \'s sentences were also excluded from those remaining so that the parents \' sentences only are given as input to the system . The learner has been run on the first &NUM utterances of the corpus . The semantics learner will currently achieve recall of &NUM with precision &NUM . The syntactic learner is dependant upon the recall of the semantic learner in that it can only proceed when a skeleton syntactic category is available for every word in the utterance ; when this is the case the success rate is high with precision in the high &NAME . A previous investigation into lexical acquisition in the framework of a categorial grammar was discussed by &NAME . His approach differs from this in several respects . &NAME \'s syntactic learner was entirely algebraic in nature ; the syntactic categories were derived by solving a set of simultaneous equations . In order to constrain his search space &NAME had to specify the syntactic categories allowed . This meant defining a category set before learning began . This is equivalent to assuming a child has innate knowledge of which syntactic categories are allowed in it \'s language . The learner presented here is not restricted in this way . &NAME \'s learner was used in conjunction with a parameter setting system ( &NAME ) in order to &NAME hypothesised category sets . For this purpose the learner was successful but &NAME still made several assumptions that would correspond to innate language ability in a child . In order to investigate these assumptions a new learning model is needed . The learner presented can acquire language from reasonably little prior knowledge and as a result the effects on learning rate as introduced by these and other assumptions can be investigated .

ac.uk, 'future of higher education , feedback welcome ', 'Hi &NAME , a quick question : I have been looking at perplexity values for the LMs I \'ve generated , and I find that on the whole the test set perplexities for the bigrams are significantly higher than for the unigrams . This is undoubtedly due to the fact that whenever a bigram is unseen , I backoff to the unigram distribution , but since the probabilities are calculated over the discounted probability mass , they are much lower than in the standard unigram case . However , the bigrams still perform significantly better , because even though the backed-off unigram probabilities are much smaller , they are still correctly proportioned . Thus , it seems that comparing perplexities for different ngrams is basically pointless - what do you think ? &CHAR ', LEGI

The report can be accessed on the website of the Department for Education and Skills at &WEBSITE Although media attention has focussed on deferred financial contributions from graduates and allowing institutions to set their own course fees , the paper also covers many other areas regarding the expansion , funding , and assessment of higher education institutes . There are many points that could be made about the proposed reforms , but the most important issues are presented in the attached annex . It is believed important that The &NAME &NAME of Engineering should comment on the White Paper , and I am writing to a number of Fellows seeking views from which a response may be prepared . The attached outline should be used as a guide , although please do not feel that it is necessary to comment on all areas , as we are aware that it is extensive . Any additional points you have to make regarding the White Paper would be most welcome . I would appreciate if any responses could reach me by Monday 17th March , and look forward to hearing your opinions on this matter . Yours , &NAME &NAME &NUM Expansion a. Must the sector expand any further ? Are there benefits in having &NUM of the population aged &NUM undertake a University degree ? b. The government \'s initiatives to promote fair access include : reforming the funding scheme , providing grants for students from lower income families , and appointing an independent Access Regulator to oversee admissions . Are these measures enough ? What should the government do to promote fair access to higher education ? c. Is the appointment of an independent Access Regulator welcomed ? d. The bulk of expansion will be towards more two-year work-focused foundation degrees . Are these a good idea ? &NUM Education and the Business Economy a. The report makes much of \' harnessing knowledge to wealth creation \' . Is the present government \'s focus on the financial benefits of a university education , and financial returns from university research damaging ? Can the benefits of academia , whether research or teaching , be measured in purely financial terms ? b. In order to encourage the transfer of knowledge and technologies between academia and business the government is setting up a network of \' Knowledge Exchanges \' , and increasing the funding to the Higher Education Innovation Fund . Are such initiatives worthwhile , or would the funding be better spent in other ways ? &NUM Funding of Infrastructure and Teaching a. The government is aiming to \' undo the years of under-investment \' in higher education . This is to be accomplished by increasing the funding available by more than &NUM percent over the next &NUM years , developing incentives to support and improve research , investing more in leading research departments , and increasing spending on research . Are these measures enough ? Are the figures the government provides enough to reverse the trend of under investment in this sector ? b. Should universities be allowed to set their own fees ( or \' Graduate Contributions \' ) per course ? Is it fair to tie such fees to an Access &NAME ? &CHAR . Can the government do more to encourage the creation of endowment funds ? &NUM Student Finance a. Are the proposals for student finance fair ? Is it reasonable to ask students to contribute to their education by paying fees ? Is a deferred contribution the best way to administer this ? b. &NAME the current proposals to increase student debt act as a deterrent to students contemplating entry into higher education ? Is the introduction of higher levels of student debt at odds with the governments aim to increase access to universities ? c. The proposals for student debt do not take into consideration the fact that a large proportion of women take career breaks to raise a family . With the average salary for women graduates lower than that of men , this would mean that most women would take longer to pay back their student debts than their male counterparts . Does the governments proposals for deferred contributions disadvantage women ? &NUM Research Assessment a. The government aims to develop criteria to assess the strength and quality of research . Is this necessary , or welcomed ? Should the government be directly involved in the choice of the type of research that is funded ? b. Is creating a new \' &NUM * \' category in the Research Assessment Exercise necessary ? &NUM . Teaching a. The government has proposed new national professional standards for teaching , and a new body to develop and promote good teaching - the &NAME &NAME &NAME . Are these welcomed ? b. The government has proposed a national training programme for external examiners . Is this necessary ? c. The University title will be made dependent on teaching degree awarding powers , meaning it will no longer be necessary to have research degree awarding powers to become a university . Is it wise to divorce teaching and research in this manner ? Should a \' University \' have to award research as well as teaching degrees ? d. Is there a demand for the establishment of an independent adjudicator to deal with student complaints ?

Special Theme As in previous years , in addition to submissions on the general topics listed above , we encourage submissions on a special theme . This year \'s special theme is : Semi-supervised / unsupervised learning and sample selection techniques for language learning ( co-training , active learning , &NAME , etc ) . Supervised &NAME &NAME methods suffer from a \' data &NAME bottleneck \' which is especially harmful for language learning tasks where a lot of training data is needed ( e.g. parsing ) .

Shared &NAME This year \'s workshop will also accept submissions for a shared task : machine learning approaches to named entity recognition . Special attention will be given to the use of multiple sources of knowledge , like training data , lists of examples and unannotated data . Interested groups will be supplied with the same training and testing material ( in several languages ) , and will all use the same evaluation criteria , thus allowing comparison between various learning methods .

It still raises many problems , for instance at the level grammatical formalisms or at the level of the algorithmic complexity , especially to handle ambiguity . However , because of recent advances , parsers are nowadays more and more widely used in large scale applications . Many approaches exist in the &NAME community that differ on the methods and objectives . The methods include for instance stochastic parsing , local parsing cascades , or more traditional complete or deep parsing . &NAME range from segmentation into chunks to deep parsing based on wide coverage grammars , including shallow and / or robust parsing . Anyway , these various methods and objectives are not necessarily in opposition and may be perceived as complementary . Despite the large number of existing grammatical formalisms , there are hints of convergences between them which open ways for ( partial ) conversions between formalisms ( for instance between &NAME and &NAME or &NAME and &NAME ) or toward \' operational \' formalisms . Also , some parsing techniques are \' generic \' and may be applied for several formalisms . Some parsing systems also aim to be multi-formalisms , relying on generic and efficient infrastructures ( indexing , memory management by structure sharing or copying , powerful unification ) . Finally , the notion of lexicalization is present in most formalisms . Last but not least , the generalization of parsers raises the issue of their evaluation . &NAME : The main objective of this special issue is a better understanding of the various approaches and techniques found in &NAME , highlighting the convergences and complementarities that may exist between them . We welcome works on any of the following issues . * Convergence between grammatical formalisms * conversions of formalisms * operational formalisms vs declarative &NUM * Convergence and complementarity in parsing approaches * robustness ( unknown words , error corrections ) * lexicalization * Integration of stochastic methods * Cascade parsing vs one-pass parsing * Evolution of parsing techniques for new formalisms * ( generic ) &NAME in &NAME * parsing strategies * ambiguity management * chart indexing * memory management ( structure sharing and copying ) * Wide coverage grammars * parsing efficiency * maintenance and modularity * &NAME evaluation Reviewers &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( LATTICE , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME University , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( University of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( UniversitE9 of &NAME , &NAME ) &NAME &NAME ( &NAME &NAME , &NAME ) Format Papers ( &NUM pages maximum ) may be submitted in &NAME , &NAME , &NAME or &NAME .

In order to realise this vision , the creation of semantic &NAME , the linking of web pages to ontologies , and the creation , evolution and interrelation of ontologies must become automatic or semi-automatic processes . In the context of new work on distributed computation , Semantic Web Services ( &NAME ) go beyond current services by adding ontologies and formal knowledge to support description , discovery , negotiation , mediation and composition . This formal knowledge is often strongly related to informal materials . For example , a service for multi-media content delivery over broadband networks might incorporate conceptual indices of the content , so that a smart &NAME ( such as next generation &NAME ) can reason about programmes to suggest to its owner . Alternatively , a service for &NAME catalogue publication has to translate between existing semi-structured catalogues and the more formal catalogues required for &NAME purposes . To make these types of services cost-effective we need automatic knowledge harvesting from all forms of content that contain natural language text or spoken data . Other services do not have this close connection with informal content , or will be created from scratch using Semantic Web authoring tools . For example , printing or compute cycle or storage services . In these cases the opposite need is present : to document services for the human reader using natural language generation . This workshop will provide a forum for workers in the field of human language technology for the Semantic Web and for Semantic Web Services to present their latest results . The aim is to provide a snapshot of the state of the art , dealing with a wide range of issues , including but not limited to : * automatic and semi-automatic &NAME of web pages ; * semantic indexing and retrieval of documents , combining the strengths of &NAME and &NAME ; * integration of data about language in language processing components with ontological data ; * robustness across genres and domains ; * ease of embedding in Semantic Web applications ; * ontology learning , evolving and merging ; * automatic web service description augmentation ; * automatic semantic structure documentation ; * language technology for automatic Web service discovery ; * adaptation of generation techniques to &NAME applications . The themes of the workshop have partly emerged from the Special Interest Group on Language Technologies and the Semantic Web ( SIG5 ) , part of the &NAME thematic network ( &WEBSITE &NAME : The issues addressed by the workshop are at the core of the Semantic Web enterprise . The killer applications that demonstrate the potential of this technology to a mass market have yet to emerge , and will likely not do so until a much larger amount of data is available .

However , the majority of work has been guided by linguistic intuition and not analysis of real usage . We intend this workshop to address this by focussing on the use of corpora to investigate figurative language . The following areas are of particular interest : * corpus-based studies of figurative aspects of any language * corpus-based studies of polysemy and context-sensitive meaning , in their relation to figurative language * multilingual or cross-lingual studies of figurative language * computational models of figurative language interpretation or generation , using results from corpora for guidance or being substantially evaluated on corpora * psychological models of figurative language processing , using results from corpora as a significant contribution * relationships between processing models and corpus studies A second intention of the workshop will be to explore the methodological issues of using corpora to study figurative language . Issues include : * illumination of the concepts of literalness , metaphor , metonymy etc. through corpus studies * interannotator agreement on what constitutes figurative language , metaphor , metonymy etc. * specific linguistic cues for figurative language , including studies of their frequencies and reliability and evaluation of their amenability to automated detection * corpus design and corpus analysis tools for figurative language studies * effects of domain , genre or corpus type on studies of figurative language ( including cross-corpus studies ) The workshop is intended to be a follow-up to our previous workshop at Corpus Linguistics &NUM . The previous workshop was well attended , with &NUM presented papers , &NUM discussion sessions and about &NUM participants . Selected papers will also appear in an issue of Metaphor and Symbol journal . The time for a second workshop is appropriate since in the last &NUM years there has been a great deal of interest and new research in this area . We intend the workshop to fill a full day with &NUM - &NUM presented papers . A proceedings of full papers will be generated from the workshop and we will also explore the possibility of publishing selected papers in a relevant journal .

Recent events have demonstrated once again the importance of inter-language communication , and reinforce the need for advances in machine translation ( MT ) and multi-lingual processing tools . The workshop will be centered around the problem of building and using parallel corpora , which are vital resources for efficiently deriving multi-lingual text processing tools . In addition to regular papers , the workshop also includes a shared task that will result in a comparative evaluation of word alignment techniques . We invite submissions of papers addressing any of the following issues : - Construction of parallel corpora , including the automatic identification and harvesting of parallel corpora from the Web . - Methods to evaluate the quality of parallel corpora and word alignments - Tools for processing parallel corpora , including automatic sentence alignment , word alignment , phrase alignment , detection of omissions and gaps in translations , and others - Using parallel corpora for data driven &NAME Translation - Using parallel corpora for the derivation of language processing tools in new languages - Using parallel corpora for automatic corpora &NAME - Language learning applied to parallel corpora - Translation memory systems as a source of aligned corpora While we invite submissions addressing any of the above topics , or related issues , we particularly welcome work involving parallel corpora addressing languages with scarce resources . We expect to make arrangements with a journal in Natural Language Processing or Computational Linguistics for a special issue that will include selected papers from this workshop . Invited Speaker : &NAME &NAME , University of Montreal Shared &NAME : All researchers who have a word alignment system available are invited to participate in the shared task , individually or as part of a team . Participants in the shared task will be provided with common sets of training data , consisting of Romanian-English and French-English parallel texts . Participants will be given approximately &NUM month to train their systems with this data , and then previously held out test data will be released . Participants will run their alignment system on this test data and submit their results , which will be evaluated using a common set of metrics . See the workshop website for details regarding the shared task . Submission format : Submissions should consist of regular full papers of max . &NUM pages , formatted following the &NAME &NUM guidelines . In addition , teams participating in the word alignment shared task are invited to submit short papers ( max . &NUM pages ) describing their systems and / or evaluation methodology .

ac.uk, 'Re : parser output on our metonymy data ', 'Hi , thanks a lot for looking at the data . &NUM Sorry for misleading you about tokenisation --- we did leave upper cases in when we parsed ; what we sent you was a file produced afterwards that included samplenumbers ( so that the examples can be tracked ) and was lower cased ( after parsing ) and which we used for extraction of the roles , but the sentences submitted to the parser had the upper case preserved . I realise now that this was the wrong thing to do and that I forgot to mention this - -- however , the mistakes that you attributed to tokenisation are now all tagging mistakes , so that your tagging comments now probably hold for these examples . Thus e.g. , the &NAME islands case has the followign tokenisation and then the tagger ( for whatever reason ) removes the upper case for Islands .

Instead of multi-word tokenisation we have such a mapping in the role extraction module so we are ok on that . The same holds for the other tokenisation cases that now are all tagging problems ( e.g. , the &NAME &NAME example --- normally the tagger gets this right as a proper name , byut in &NUM case it did n\'t) . &NUM Thanks for the comments about the parse timeout and the tagging thresholding --- it looks as if this might solve a lot of our cases . &NAME weighting might be sensible , too , as we do mostly care about precision , not recall .

Interest in automatic summarization and question answering continues to grow , motivated by the explosion of on-line information sources and advances in natural language processing and information retrieval . In fact , various forms of automatic summarization and question answering will undoubtedly be indispensable given the massive information universes that lie ahead in the 21st century . &NAME and question answering involves the extraction or generation of text snippets to fulfill some user needs . Rule-based or statistical-based summarization and &NAME systems have shown promising results in the &NAME &NAME tracks , &NAME &NAME , and &NAME &NAME ; it is , however , very difficult to find good evaluation functions or rules that work well across domains or in all questions because there are many system parameters that must be carefully tuned in order to achieve good system performance . In consequence , various machine learning ( ML ) techniques have recently been applied to summarization and &NAME systems . The purpose of this workshop is to provide a forum for exploring the commonality underling this diversity of problem domain and approaches . The workshop has the following goals : - to bring together communities of researchers who apply machine learning techniques to summarization and &NAME systems , - to deepen the summarization and &NAME community \'s understanding of the state of the art in machine learning , - to identify summarization and QA-related problems for which &NAME techniques might be appropriate , and - to advance the state of the art of summarization and &NAME technologies . Topics appropriate to this workshop include : - summarization or &NAME systems with &NAME techniques , - novel or improved &NAME techniques for summarization or &NAME , - effective feature extraction methods for characterizing summarization or &NAME , - metrics and benchmarks for evaluating the effect of machine learning techniques in summarization or &NAME systems , - generation for summarization or &NAME , - cross-language or multilingual &NAME , - integration with Web and &NAME access , - corpora creation for summarization or &NAME , - interfaces and tools for summarization or &NAME .

ac.uk, 'letter from past presidents ', 'Dear colleagues , I do not know the history of corporate involvement by the &NAME in public issues of language use and language politics further back than &NUM . However I agree with &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME in regretting the public position taken by ( some of ) the past presidents of &NAME on the matter of &NAME \'s boycott - or rather , in regretting the manner of taking it . I do n\'t think it matters that my dues are not currently paid up , as it is clearly the general intention of the &NAME to represent &NAME in &NAME . I would be very surprised if members of the mass media did not take the letter in question as &NAME facto representing majority opinion in the linguistics community , no matter how carefully the authors qualify their ( undoubtedly honourable ) intentions , since such qualifications are exactly the sort of thing that gets overlooked by non-academics in general and the media in particular . In that respect I very much appreciated April &NAME \'s stance in refusing to endorse the letter without formal support from the membership . It \'s not clear to me from reading the past presidents \' letter why they felt it necessary to go forward without securing such support ( or perhaps discovering its absence ) . The &NAME affair has been reported for some months now , and the letter does not appear to highlight any radically new or time-sensitive developments . ( It \'s also not clear to me what committee April \'s letter refers to -- some of this may be down to my ignorance of developments at the last meeting . ) I am however familiar with the participation of the Linguistic Society of &NAME in matters of public interest concerning language over the last &NUM years . While the &NAME has not always been effective or unproblematic in its approach , it has generally sought member approval in an organised fashion for statements and resolutions -- sometimes , as in the &NAME case , within a few weeks after significant events occurred . More importantly , in recent years it has voiced corporate opinion primarily on issues in which &NAME are significantly united , and which fall under our professional remit , such as the harmful misconceptions underlying the English-Only movement ( &NUM ) , the protection of basic language rights ( &NUM ) , the systematicity of African American English and the pedagogical soundness of the &NAME school system \'s approach in the Ebonics controversy ( &NUM ) , the academic effectiveness of bilingual education ( &NUM ) , and the adequacy of signed languages ( &NUM ) . See webpage at ( &WEBSITE these cases , the burden for summarising research and drafting a statement for presentation to the membership has indeed fallen on &NUM individual , as in the contrasting case &NAME describes , but it is then handled through the Committee on Social and Political Concerns in a regular way . Perhaps some such more elaborated structure might be useful for &NAME , in view of the concerns that members have voiced . The issues of academic freedom raised in the past presidents \' letter are indeed important &NUM for all academics , but I cannot see that there is anything linguistic about them -- other than the content of the journal in question , which has not surfaced as an issue in any of the reports I have seen .

edu, '[ &NAME ] MEAD - multidocument summarization environment ', 'MEAD &NAME released &WEBSITE &NAME is a multi-document summarization system with multi-lingual capabilities . The &NAME system implements extractive summarization , whereby summaries are produced by selecting a subset of highly relevant sentences from the cluster \'s overall set of sentences . &NAME can summarize clusters of English documents on most POSIX-conforming operating systems and can summarize clusters of &NAME Chinese documents on a subset of these operating systems . The &NAME system has been under development since &NUM . Versions &NUM and &NUM were developed at the University of &NAME . Version &NUM was developed at a six-week workshop at the &NAME &NAME University . Versions &NUM through &NUM were incremental improvements by the &NAME workshop team members . With version &NUM , development of &NAME has moved back to the University of &NAME . MEAD &NUM represents a major refactoring of previous &NAME versions . The current version supports all the functionality of previous versions , but also has many new features . Some of these are : - Version &NUM is much more configurable than previous versions of &NAME . It allows for both system-wide and user-specific configuration files . - It has a simplified user interface . Previous versions required the user to manually edit a mead.config file and use a combination of &NAME shell commands to produce summaries . While the current version still supports this interface , MEAD &NUM has a single script interface that essentially eliminates the need for manual editing of mead.config files . - &NAME &NAME , a previously free-standing tool for evaluating summarizers , has been incorporated with the current version of &NAME . This allows users to evaluate existing summaizers , as well as evaluate the performance of the base MEAD system and any user modifications . MEAD &NAME supports co-selection ( percent agreement , precision , recall , &NAME ) and content-based evaluation metrics ( such as word overlap and longest common subsequence ) , as well as relative utility . - &NAME uses an extensive collection of custom &NAME modules that may be suitable for use in many natural language applications , including for example , question answering . - &NAME and lead-based summarizers have been incorporated into the &NAME framework . These summarizers provide useful examples of how to create new &NAME modules . - The documentation for the current version has been expanded , and now includes a significant number of example use cases and tutorials for customizing each of &NAME \'s modules .

ac.uk, 'error analysis ', '&NAME &NAME , I \'ve started analysing what &NAME gets wrong , and since it gets plenty wrong , it \'s taking a while to work through it all , but here are my notes on the sort of things I \'m finding ...

All of these are untagged since &NAME ca n\'t come up with a parse tree , not even a &CHAR / fragx for this sentence .

Also , &NAME tags it as a TIME not DATE since it recognises Dec. as a month ( so classifies it as a temporal expression ) but has n\'t applied its date rule : &NAME &NAME / date : N2 [ &NAME TEMP ] -- ) ( N2 [ &NAME &NAME ] ) H0 Why not ? &NAME applies it here : ( |P1 / p_np-nt||On : &NAME | ( |NP / date/--- | |January : &NAME | ( |NP / num | &NAME : &NAME | ) ) ) ) which is also a &NAME followed by a NP / num ... ? ( &NAME TYPE\' LOCATION\' &NAME ( &NUM ) ( &NAME TYPE\' PERSON\' &NAME ( &NUM ) Perfect bracketing but &NAME is not in the lexicon as a NNL1 so &NAME guesses name -- ) PERSON . &NAME &NUM NP1 &NUM &NAME &NUM NP1 &NUM in the direction of ( &NAME TYPE\' PERSON\' )Kimmel ( /ENAMEX)\'s and ( &NAME TYPE\' PERSON\' &NAME ( /ENAMEX)\'s advocates by criticizing top ( &NAME TYPE\' ORGANIZATION\' )Na vy ( &NUM ) and ( &NAME TYPE\' ORGANIZATION\' )Army ( &NUM ) officials in ( &NAME TYPE\' LOCATION\' &NAME ( &NUM ) for being neither energetic nor effective in getting \'\' warnings to ( &NAME TYPE\' LOCATION\' )&NAME ( &NUM ) about alarming intelligence reports that &CHAR ( &NAME TYPE\' LOCATION\' &NAME ( /ENAMEX)-Japanese rupture was just hours away . in the direction of ( &NAME TYPE\' PERSON \' ) &NAME \'s and &NAME \'s advocates by criticizing top Navy and Army officials in &NAME for being neither energetic nor effective in getting \'\' warnings to &NAME about alarming intelligence reports that a &NAME -Japanese rupture was just hours away ( &NUM ) .

But it * would * have missed tagging Navy likewise dewspite it \'s being tagged &NAME . Why does the org tag not appear here : ( |N1 / n1_n1-coord/- | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |Navy : &NAME ?

( |V1 / v_np-name | |absolve : &NAME | ( |NP / n-pretit_n1-name | |Admiral : &NAME | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |Kimmel : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) &NAME correctly identifies Admiral as a title part of a name , but then classifies the whole thing as a name -- ) PERSON rather than just the following name . This is more a reflection on my choise of mapping to &NAME classifications though ... On the other hand , &NAME definitely should n\'t have bracketed \' of accountability \' together with the rest of the name , and has mistagged General as an adjective , presumably because also of the incorrect bracketing . ( |NP / n1_n1-name/- | ( |N1 / ap_n1/- | ( |AP / a1 | ( |A1 / a | |General : &NAME | ) ) ( |N1 / n_pp-of | &NAME : &NAME | ( |PP / p1 | ( |P1 / p_n1 | |of : &NAME | ( |N1 / &CHAR | |accountability : &NAME | ) ) ) ) ) ) ) ) General &NUM &NAME &NUM NNS1 &NUM NNSB1 &NUM the &NAME report said . the ( &NAME TYPE\' PERSON\' )Dorn ( &NUM ) report said . Here &NAME has tagged &CHAR the part of report named after a person as a PERSON .

Membership of the society for &NUM remains at &NUM pounds ( &NUM pounds for students ) . If not already paid , subscriptions can be brought to the meeting . Cheques should be made payable to &NAME University Linguistic Society . AGREEMENT AND MOVEMENT TYPES The talk concerns certain conditions on agreement and movement in ( mainly ) Icelandic raising constructions . In Icelandic a seem-type raising verb takes an optional experiencer argument , assigned dative case . The dative &NAME is usually moved to subject position , in which case the seem-verb can optionally agree with the subject of the infinitival clause , as in ( &NUM ) . ( &NUM ) &NAME &NAME &CHAR [ the horses to be slow ] ( Icelandic with English words ) Or the dative &NAME can remain in &NAME if it is indefinite , as in ( &NUM ) . In that case the matrix verb and the embedded subject ca n\'t agree , so the verb gets default &NAME form . The intervening dative &NAME blocks agreement . ( &NUM ) There seems/ * seem ( to ) a man [ the horses to be slow ] If the dative &NAME is wh-moved , it still blocks agreement . ( &NUM ) ( To ) what man do you think that seems/ * seem &CHAR [ the horses to be slow ] ? A wh-trace blocks agreement , but an NP-trace does n\'t &NUM so to speak . This has various interesting implicatio ns for the theory of agreement and movement . For &NUM thing it presupposes that the wh-phrase moves directly to &NAME , without passing through &NAME , or the relevant trace &NAME be a wh-trace . It is far from obvious how this can be ensured . And why would NP-trace and wh-trace be different , to begin with ? Matters are further complicated by the fact that although the wh-trace blocks agreement , it does not block NP-movement across it .

com, '&NAME &NAME ', 'Hi Dr &NAME . I \'d like to do an intensive but part-time &NAME . My specific area of interest is the commercially useful analysis of business language text . This may include for example analysis of political bias , positive / negative tone , identification of recommendations , and rating of risk . I \'ve backgrounded myself already , reading quite a few papers and books on sentiment classification and information extraction ( about to embark on machine learning ) . I have no experience of academic linguistics , but I have been an \' information architect \' in web systems for clients such as &NAME , &NAME and News International . I have a &NUM degree in Civil Engineering ( &NUM ) , a &NAME &NAME &NAME and &NUM years experience in strategic marketing and business information systems . I \'m currently &NUM and a director in a growing web software company . I wonder if you could give me some idea of : &CHAR ) my suitability to &NAME &CHAR ) whether I could work on a \' distance learning \' basis &CHAR ) whether the timing of my application fits with the application schedule I have attached a summary of my interests below . &NAME regards , &NAME &NAME &NAME All Out &NAME &WEBSITE email : &EMAIL &NUM &NAME Road &NAME &NAME &NAME &WEBSITE &NUM &NUM &NUM ( direct ) &NUM &NUM &NUM ( main ) &NUM RATIONALE Recent research in the areas of sentiment classification , information extraction and machine learning applied to language processing has resulted in systems which can intelligently interpret documents with respect to particular tasks . This work has achieved success rates which are scientifically significant ; indeed in some experimental applications , success rates have approached those of humans . Many researchers have created innovative techniques to harness a diverse range of text resources ( including search engines , thesauri and internet content ) . However , we are still some way off the success rates of human interpretation in the commercial field . Perhaps now is the right time to start the development of commercially satisfactory machine interpretation ( &NAME ) which can achieve near-human interpretation within the wide limits of commercial applications . Ultimately , &NAME \'s success will be measured by its adoption within the market . Initially however , the commercial market needs to exert its influence on this field , and researchers need to understand commercial expectations , to examine their implications on outputs and inputs , and to develop viable trial systems . This is where I wish to focus my attention . &NUM RESEARCH INTERESTS My research interests are in the applied ( ie commercially useful ) relationship between information extraction ( ie summarising key facts ) and sentiment classification . In particular , I am concerned with defining the potential applications of this relationship within a business context and in attempting to achieve a machine-interpretation accuracy which is acceptable to the market , within a defined scope ( possibly close to human accuracy levels ) . I wish to demonstrate that a single engine should be able to both perform and relate information extraction and sentiment classification simultaneously from natural language in common business use , mainly through shallow techniques in machine learning . Furthermore , I hope to show that a typical business person should be able to operate such a system given a mixture of pre-configured and user-defined input parameters , and achieve an accuracy which is high enough to satisfy commercial expectations - perhaps over &NUM . For example , I would hope that my work will contribute towards making the following activity possible : a market analyst submits &NUM articles from the Financial &NAME on the footwear industry to an online service she enters the key topic areas of interest ( eg growth , risk , retail demand , innovation ) Online service produces - a summary of key facts and related author sentiments on these topics - a clear statement of certainty on each area &NUM PROPOSED RESEARCH I intend to conduct applied research into a modular system which contains the following components : &NUM &NUM . Sentiment selection by user &NAME the resources and processes to enable users to select sentiments , which will embrace : &CHAR ) user choice from pre-defined sentiments &CHAR ) user-defined sentiments &CHAR ) selecting multiple simultaneous sentiments &NUM &NUM .

Grammatical Inference ( GI ) is a collection of methodologies for learning grammars from training data . The most traditional field of application of &NAME has been syntactic pattern recognition . In the recent past , however , concerted efforts from diverse disciplines to find tractable inference techniques have added new dimensions and opened up unchartered territories . Applications of &NAME in more nontraditional fields include &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME and Information Retrieval . Development of algorithms for &NAME has evolved over the years from dealing with only positive training samples to more fundamental efforts that try to circumvent the lack of negative samples .. This idea is pursued in stochastic grammars and languages which attempt to overcome absence of negative samples by gathering statistical information from available positive samples . Also within the framework of information theory , probability estimation technique for &NAME &NAME Model known as &NAME and for Context-Free language , the Inside-Outside algorithm are focal point of investigations in stochastic grammar field . Techniques that use intelligent search to infer the rules of grammar are showing considerable promise . Recently , there has been a surge of activities dealing with specialized neural network architecture and dedicated learning algorithms to approach &NAME problems . In more customary track , research in learning classes of transducers continue to arouse interests in &NAME community . Close interaction / collaboration between different disciplines and availability of powerful computers are fueling novel research efforts in &NAME . The objective of the Special Issue is to present the current status of this topic through the works of researchers in different disciplines . Original and tutorial papers are solicited that address theoretical and practical issues on this theme .

However , there exist many application areas ( e.g. in network packet processing ) where 3rd party code would benefit from the ability to execute below the kernel boundary . In the Open Kernel Environment ( &NAME ) , we allow any party with the appropriate credentials to load fully optimised native code in a safe manner in the heart of the &NAME kernel . Depending on the credentials the code will get more or less access to resources , such as &NAME time , heap , stack , &NAME , etc. The restrictions are enforced by a trusted compiler . In other words , the &NAME offers a safe and flexible environment for programming the kernel . In this talk , I will give an overview of the &NAME , and of the mechanisms that were used to restrict the modules .

There are many documents in each hierarchy , tempering any data sparsity problems .

I think the proposals are now better , but I would be grateful if you had a quick look . I left them in your pigeon hole in an envelope . They ended up being quite similar in terms of the overall goal : They both propose developing a system for automatic large-scale / domain-specific verb classification ( building on the extant technology -- rasp parser , subcat extraction , &NAME clustering -- and improving / expanding on this where needed ) and using the final version of this system to acquire a large domain-independent classification for verbs , which will be made available for public use , along with the software which can be used to tune it specific to domains / tasks . They differ in that &NUM ) &NAME proposal involves experimenting with what kind of linguistically interesting novel information ( aside verb classes ) we can acquire from corpus data using our technology . Where possible , this information will be incorporated into the final resource I build . &NUM ) &NAME proposal is technically a bit more ambitious , it concentrates on extracting verb classes and class participants ( no other novel info ) , and involves developing a new task-based evaluation in the context of event extraction . If you feel they are not different enough , I \'ll then change / modify them further . Also , I am happy to improve them further where required . &NAME does n\'t have any deadlines , but it would be good to submit asap so that the proposal will get to the July board .

ac.uk, '', 'A few people have spotted the evidence that we have started using a problem tracking system for dealing with queries to the system administrators . Although the system should be largely transparent , this is just a quick note to explain what is going on , and how you can help the system to run smoothly . A problem with support addresses such as sys-admin is that of ensuring that every problem is dealt with by somebody , and that we try to avoid wasted effort by having more than &NUM person pick up the same message . A secondary problem is that of keeping track of the correspondence for a long-running problem , especially when responsibility is transferred from &NUM person to another . We are therefore experimenting with a problem tracking system called &WEBSITE . Whenever a problem enters the system is is assigned a unique ticket number , which is put into the subject line of all further correspondence . You can help the system run smoothly by observing these guidelines : - Please try to confine an initial message to a single problem , or very closely related problems . If you put completely unrelated matters in a single message , it may be difficult to handle them in parallel , or a supplementary question may be missed . - If you want to add some correspondence to an existing query , always reply to a message which includes the ticket number if you have one . We will shortly be arranging that an automatic reply is sent out when a ticket is created . If you want to add more information before you have had a reply from a human , you can reply to this . The system is being introduced gradually , so in the short term you may find that some questions are answered the old way whilst others are given tickets . - When we believe a ticket has been resolved , you should get a message saying so . If you agree , do nothing . If you disagree , either immediately or after some time , replying to a message which has the ticket number will automatically reopen it ( with the advantage that we will be able to see the previous correspondence instantly ) .

Direct commissions from sales you make yourself and commissions from sales made by people you introduce to the business . Residual income is the secret of the wealthy . It means investing time or money once and getting paid again and again and again . In network marketing , it also means getting paid for the work of others . The enclosed information is something I almost let slip through my fingers . Fortunately , sometime later I re-read everything and gave some thought and study to it . My name is &NAME &NAME . &NUM years ago , the corporation I worked for , the past &NUM years , down-sized and my position was eliminated . After many unproductive job interviews , I decided to open my own business . Over the past year , I incurred many unforeseen financial problems . I owed my family , friends and creditors over $ &NUM , &NUM . I just could n\'t seem to make ends meet . I had to refinance and borrow against my home to support my family and struggling business . AT THAT MOMENT something significant happened in my life and I am writing to share the experience in hopes that this will change your life , FINANCIALLY , FOREVER ! ! ! In mid December , I received this program via e-mail . &NUM month \'s prior to receiving this program I had been sending away for information on various business opportunities . All of the programs I received , in my opinion , were not cost effective . They were either too difficult for me to comprehend or the initial investment was too much for me to risk to see if they would work or not . One claimed that I would make a million dollars in &NUM year ... it did n\'t tell me I \'d have to write a best selling book to make it ! But , as I was saying , in December of &NUM I received this program . I did n\'t send for it , or ask for it , they just got my name off a mailing list . THANK GOODNESS FOR THAT ! After reading it several times , to make sure I was reading it correctly , I could n\'t believe my eyes . Here was a MONEY MAKING PHENOMENON . I could invest as much as I wanted to start , without putting me further into debt . After I got a pencil and paper and figured it out , I would at least get my money back . But like most of you I was still a little skeptical and a little worried about the legal aspects of it all . So I checked it out with the &NAME &NAME Office ( &NUM &NUM 24-hrs ) and they confirmed that it is indeed legal ! After determining the program was LEGAL and NOT A CHAIN LETTER , I decided \' WHY NOT . \' Initially I sent out &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The great thing about e-mail is that I do n\'t need any money for printing to send out the program , and because all of my orders are fulfilled via e-mail , the only expense is my time . I \'m telling you as it is , I hope it does n\'t turn you off , but I promised myself that I would not \' rip-off \' anyone , no matter how much money it cost me . In less than &NUM week , I was starting to receive orders for REPORT # &NUM . By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . Your goal is to \'RECEIVE at least &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . If you do n\'t, SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO ! \' My first step in making $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM days was done . By January &NUM , I had received &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM . Your goal is to \'RECEIVE AT LEAST &NUM ORDERS FOR REPORT # &NUM WITHIN &NUM WEEKS . IF NOT , SEND OUT MORE PROGRAMS UNTIL YOU DO . ONCE YOU HAVE &NUM ORDERS , THE REST IS EASY , RELAX , YOU WILL MAKE YOUR $ &NUM , &NUM GOAL . \' Well , I had &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , &NUM more than I needed . So I sat back and relaxed . By March &NUM , of my e-mailing of &NUM , &NUM , I received $ &NUM , &NUM with more coming in every day . I paid off ALL my debts and bought a much needed new car . Please take time to read the attached program , IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE FOREVER ! Remember , it wo n\'t work if you do n\'t try it . This program does work , but you must follow it EXACTLY ! Especially the rules of not trying to place your name in a different place . It wo n\'t work , you \'ll lose out on a lot of money ! In order for this program to work , you must meet your goal of &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM , and &NUM orders for REPORT # &NUM and you will make $ &NUM , &NUM or more in &NUM days . I AM LIVING PROOF THAT IT WORKS ! If you choose not to participate in this program , I am sorry . It really is a great opportunity with little cost or risk to you . If you choose to participate , follow the program and you will be on your way to financial security . If you are a business owner and in financial trouble , as I was , or you want to start your own business , consider this a good luck sign . I DID ! Sincerely , &NAME &NAME &NAME Do you have any idea what $ &NUM , &NUM looks like piled up on a kitchen table ? IT \'S AWESOME ! &CHAR PERSONAL NOTE FROM THE ORIGINATOR OF THIS PROGRAM : By the time you have read the enclosed program and reports you should have concluded that such a program , one that is legal , could not have been created by an amateur . Let me tell you a little about myself . I had a profitable business for &NUM years . Then in &NUM my business began falling off . I was doing the same things that were previously successful for me , but it was n\'t working . Finally , I figured it out . It was n\'t me , it was the economy . &NAME and recession had replaced the stable economy that had been with us since &NUM . I do n\'t have to tell you what happened to the unemployment rate ... because many of you know from first hand experience . There were more failures and bankruptcies than ever before . The middle class was vanishing . Those who knew what they were doing invested wisely and moved up . Those who did not , including those who never had anything to save or invest , were moving down into the ranks of the poor . As the saying goes , \' THE RICH GET RICHER AND THE POOR GET POORER . \' The traditional methods of making money will never allow you to \'move up \' or \' get &NAME \' . You have just received information that can give you financial freedom for the rest of your life , with \' NO RISK \' and \' JUST A LITTLE BIT OF EFFORT . \' You can make more money in the next few months than you have ever imagined . I should also point out that I will not see a penny of this money , nor anyone else who has provided a testimonial for this program . I have already made over &NUM MILLION DOLLARS ! I have retired from the program after sending out over &NUM , &NUM programs . Follow the program EXACTLY AS INSTRUCTED . Do not change it in any way . It works exceedingly well as it is now . Remember to e-mail a copy of this exciting report to everyone you can think of . One of the people you send this to may send out &NUM , &NUM ... and your name will be on everyone of them ! Remember though , the more you send out the more potential customers you will reach . So my friend , I have given you the ideas , information , materials and opportunity to become financially independent , IT IS NOW UP TO YOU ! HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WORKS HERE \'S HOW THIS AMAZING PROGRAM WILL MAKE YOU &NUM OF DOLLARS INSTRUCTIONS : This method of raising capital REALLY WORKS &NUM \% , EVERY TIME . I am sure that you could use up to $ &NUM , &NUM or more in the next &NUM days . Before you say \' BULL ... \' , please read this program carefully . This is not a chain letter , but a perfectly legal money making opportunity . Basically , this is what you do : As with all multi-level businesses , we build our business by recruiting new partners and selling our products . Every state in the &NAME allows you to recruit new multi-level business partners , and we offer a product for EVERY dollar sent . YOUR ORDERS COME BY MAIL AND ARE FILLED BY E-MAIL , so you are not involved in personal selling . You do it privately in your own home , store or office .

Once you have received &NUM or more orders for REPORT # &NUM , YOU CAN RELAX , because the system is already working for you , and the cash can continue to roll in !

Especially the rule of not trying to place your name in a different position , it wo n\'t work and you \'ll lose a lot of potential income . I \'m living proof that it works . It really is a great opportunity to make relatively easy money , with little cost to you . If you do choose to participate , follow the program exactly , and you \'ll be on your way to financial security . &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME My name is &NAME . My wife , &NAME , and I live in &NAME , &NAME . I am a cost accountant with a major &NAME Corporation and I make pretty good money . When I received the program I grumbled to &NAME about receiving \' junk mail . \' I made fun of the whole thing , spouting my knowledge of the population and percentages involved . I \' knew \' it would n\'t work . &NAME totally ignored my supposed intelligence and jumped in with both feet . I made merciless fun of her , and was ready to lay the old \' I told you so \' on her when the thing did n\'t work ... well , the laugh was on me ! Within &NUM weeks she had received over &NUM responses . Within &NUM days she had received over $ &NUM , &NUM in $ &NUM bills ! I was shocked ! I was sure that I had it all figured and that it would n\'t work . I AM a believer now . I have joined &NAME in her \' hobby . \' I did have &NUM more years until retirement , but I think of the \' rat race \' and it \'s not for me . We owe it all to &NAME . &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME I just want to pass along my best wishes and encouragement to you . Any doubts you have will vanish when your first orders come in. &NUM even checked with the &NAME &NAME Office to verify that the plan was legal . It definitely is ! IT WORKS ! &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME The main reason for this letter is to convince you that this system is honest , lawful , extremely profitable , and is a way to get a large amount of money in a short time . I was approached several times before I checked this out . I joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . To my astonishment , I received $ &NUM , &NUM in the first &NUM weeks , with money still coming in. &NAME &NAME &NAME , Esq. Not being the gambling type , it took me several weeks to make up my mind to participate in this plan . But conservative that I am , I decided that the initial investment was so little that there was just no way that I would n\'t get enough orders to at least get my money back . &NAME , was I surprised when I found my medium-size post office box crammed with orders ! For a while , it got so overloaded that I had to start picking up my mail at the window . I \'ll make more money this year than any &NUM years of my life before . The nice thing about this plan is that it does n\'t matter where in the &NAME people live . There simply is n\'t a better investment with a faster return . &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME I had received this program before . I deleted it , but later I wondered if I should n\'t have given it a try . Of course , I had no idea who to contact to get another copy , so I had to wait until I was e-mailed another program ... &NUM months passed then it came ... I did n\'t delete this one ! ... I made more than $ &NUM , &NUM on the first try ! ! D. &NAME , &NAME , IN This is my third time to participate in this plan . We have quit our jobs , and will soon buy a home on the beach and live off the interest on our money . The only way on earth that this plan will work for you is if you do it .

To assist you with marketing your business on the &NAME , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more ! There are &NUM primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes . And we will assume that you and those who join you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receives only a &NUM response ( the response could be much better , but let \'s just say it \'s only &NUM . Also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails with a &NUM response . That equals only &NUM orders for Report # &NUM ( That \'s &pound; &NUM ) . Those &NUM people who order Report # &NUM , each send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails for a grand total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . If only &NUM respond with orders , you get &NUM orders for report # &NUM ( That \'s &pound; &NUM ) . Those &NUM who order Report # &NUM from you each send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , you will receive &NUM order for Report # &NUM ( That \'s &pound; &NUM , &NUM ) . The &NUM people who order Report # &NUM from you send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each generating a total of &NUM million e-mails . With a &NUM response , you would receive &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM send &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM million ( &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ) e-mails . At a response rate of &NUM this will generate &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM to you ( or &pound; &NUM , &NUM ) . Your income in this example would be : Report # &NUM &NUM Report # &NUM &NUM Report # &NUM &NUM , &NUM Report # &NUM &NUM , &NUM Report # &NUM &NUM , &NUM Total &pound; &NUM , &NUM The numbers do n\'t lie . Get a pencil & paper or calculator and figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you WILL make a lot of money ! ! ! REMEMBER FRIEND , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , &NUM e-mails each or more ? There are over &NUM million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . Believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! METHOD # &NUM : PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the &NAME is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add Method # &NUM as you go along . For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the Report the ordered . That \'s it . Always provide same day service on all orders .

While the &NAME Secure &NUM machine is tested at the &NAME airport , passengers are given the choice of using it to save time in security checks . The low-level X-ray scanner is supposed to produce a hazy outline of the body but &NAME \'s &NAME television has discovered the images are more explicit . The &NAME footage included a clear image of a man \'s buttocks and genitalia . Associate director of the American Civil Liberties &NAME ( &NAME ) , &NAME &NAME said the organization opposes the widespread use of what want can be considered a virtual strip search . &NAME added that the machine has \' tremendous potential for embarrassment . \' Supporters of the scanner claim it offers a sure-fire defense against terrorists and drug smugglers . The naked images are said to be wiped from the computer \'s memory as soon as a person passes through the scanning cubicle . The machine is one of several prototypes being tested at the Advanced Technology Checkpoint Project in &NAME Airport . 3D)) ( ( 3D3D ) ) Space the &NAME Frontier -- The National Space Society ( &NAME ) and Space Adventures , Ltd. , announced a joint program to promote commercial space exploration and to advance the day when humans will live and work in space .

Space Adventures will also operate an &NAME members-only tour . &NAME &NUM / &NUM , Space Adventures , Ltd. , &NUM / &NUM . 3D)) ( ( 3D3D ) ) &NAME -- A number of years ago , while on a cruise , a needlepoint enthusiast brought this duct-taped contraption . When I asked what is was , she explained that she loved to needlepoint and whenever she went away -- to a resort or on a cruise -- the lighting was so bad she rigged up her own portable light . It was a crude flourescent light taped into a make-do socket and cord . She was right , the lighting in hotel rooms and cabins leaves much to be desired . Even when I sit at a desk in hotel rooms to write something down , read over notes or input information into a computer , the desk task lights are generally so low wattage that it is hard to read , yet alone do paper work . Some travelers may resort to bringing a larger wattage light bulb along . If working on the road is important to you , the Cadillac of portable lighting is available . Environmental Lighting Concepts has come up with Ott-Lite Technology , a portable vision saver light lamp . Developed by Dr. &NAME &NAME &NAME , a light researcher , &NAME \'s full light spectrum technology , which is endorsed by low vision clinics , replicates natural daylight so it reduces glare and eye strain . &CHAR &NUM watt bulb provides enough light to replace up to a 75-watt incandescent bulb . When I sat down at a desk and turned on the Ott-Lite lamp , it flooded my workspace with a crisp white light that made the smallest letters look sharp and colors unbelievably bright . The same workspace illuminated by a standard light bulb was yellow and muddled looking . Had I not tried this experiment , I would have not believed the difference . The lamp has a small footprint , a roundish 5-inch diameter , that allows it to fight in the smallest spaces . Its energy- efficient 13-watts of power allows it to operate cool , radiating almost no heat . The portable Ott-Lite lamp \'s downside is its weight , about &NUM pounds . The weight should have no impact on road warriors who travel by car . They should count it as one of their essential pieces of equipment . However , lugging around an extra &NUM pounds in my carry- on bag does n\'t have much of an appeal for me . Ott-Lite products are sold at department stores and specialty retailers nationwide . In addition to the portable lamp , there is a full line of styles for the home and office . &NUM / &NUM &WEBSITE 3D)) ( ( 3D3D ) ) &CHAR &NAME &NAME &NAME -- Purchase Tickets by Sep. &NUM -- &CHAR &NAME introduces fares to &NAME from $ &NUM each way .

It tells of 19-year-old &NAME driving from &NAME , Va . to visit a friend in &NAME at &NUM p.m. She was driving just over &NUM mph when an unmarked police car pulled up behind her and put his lights on . &NAME \'s parents have always warned her to never pull over for an unmarked car on the side of the road , but rather wait until you get to a public place such as a gas station . &NAME listened to her parents advice and called # &NUM on her cell phone to tell the dispatcher that she would not pull over right away and told the dispatcher that there was an unmarked police car behind her . The dispatcher checked to confirm if there was an unmarked police car where she was . There was n\'t and she was told to keep driving , remain calm and that the police were on the way . &NUM minutes later , &NUM police cars surrounded her and the unmarked car behind her . They pulled the guy from the car and tackled him to the ground . The man was a convicted rapist and wanted for other crimes . Several news organizations were unable to confirm this exact incident really happened . There are news reports from around the &NAME detailing similar crimes and attempted crimes &NUM including rape &NUM perpetrated by drivers impersonating police officers in unmarked cars . Some police departments do , therefore , recommend using caution if you \'re pulled over by an unmarked vehicle in a secluded area after dark . Communicate your intention to stop by slowing down and turning on emergency flashers or a turn signal . The police suggest you drive to the nearest well-lit , populated area before stopping . If you \'re still suspicious , keep your doors locked and only partially roll down your window when the officer approaches . Ask to see a badge and photo I.D. Using your cell phone to contact a police dispatcher ( as advised in the email ) is an option . Be aware that the \'dial # &NUM \' option does not work in every state . If you are n\'t sure , dial &NUM instead . Contact your local / state police or the American Automobile Association for specific information about emergency cell phone numbers in your area .

Imagine being able to make over a half million dollars every &NUM to &NUM months from your home . THANK \'S TO THE COMPUTER &NAME AND THE INTERNET AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV : PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! Does this headline look familiar ? Of course it does . You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . And reported elsewhere in the world . His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . &NAME Bills , &NUM , &NUM and Hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . \'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM Dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . He came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive Several Thousand Dollars in &NAME Bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM Bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM plus - please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! Before you say \' \' &NAME \'\' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can \' follow the simple instruction \' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \'\' . DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . This is what one had to say : \' \' Thanks to this profitable opportunity \' . I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . To my astonishment , I received a total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in \'\' . &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME . Another said : \' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . I followed the simple instructions and &NAME . . ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in.

Treat it as such and you will be VERY profitable in a short period of time After you have ordered all &NUM reports , take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # &NUM . This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . Email them and ask that \'s what I always did . Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM . Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM . Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM . Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # 2 Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # &NUM Position . PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY ( Just cut and paste !

DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receives only a &NUM ( &NUM / &NUM of &NUM ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM ) . Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . That\'s3D100 people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people send &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM million e-mail sent out . The &NUM response is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . THAT \'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH &NUM $ &NUM , &NUM ( half a million dollars ) . Your total income in this example is : &NUM ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . ... $ &NUM , &NUM ... &NAME &NAME $ &NUM , &NUM NUMBERS DO NOT &NAME GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT , YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ( I did it was $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM months ) REMEMBER , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , &NUM e-mails each or more ? There are &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting , with thousands of more coming on line every day . Believe me , there is n\'t any better way to make money ! METHOD # &NUM : BY PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add METHOD # &NUM as you go along . For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered . That \'s it . Always provide same day service on all orders . This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . The reason for the \' cash \' is not because this is illegal or somehow \' wrong \' . It is simply about time . Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc. Concealing it is simply so no &NUM can &NAME there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY . &NAME : Always send $ &NUM cash ( &NAME CURRENCY ) for each Report . Checks NOT accepted . Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least &NUM sheets of paper or foil will also work . On one of those sheets of paper , write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering , YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address .

If you did not , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . * * Once you have received &NUM or more orders for Report# &NUM , YOU CAN RELAX , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER : Every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a Different report . You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you . IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN .

To assist you with marketing your business on the &NAME , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of fre &CHAR classified ads and much more ! There are &NUM primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes . And we will assume that you and those who join you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receives only a &NUM response ( the response could be much better , but let \'s just say it \'s only &NUM . Also , many people will send out hundreds of thousands of e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails with a &NUM response . That equals only &NUM orders for Report # &NUM ( That \'s &pound; &NUM ) . Those &NUM people who order Report # &NUM , each send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails for a grand total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . If only &NUM respond with orders , you get &NUM orders for report # &NUM ( That \'s &pound; &NUM ) . Those &NUM who order Report # &NUM from you each se nd out &NUM , &NUM e-mails for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , you &CHAR ill receive &NUM order for Report # &NUM ( That \'s &pound; &NUM , &NUM ) . The &NUM people who or der Report # &NUM from you send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each generating a total of &NUM million e-mails . With a &NUM response , you would receive &NUM , &NUM orders for Repor &CHAR # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM send &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM million ( &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ) e-mails . At a response rate of &NUM this will generate &NUM , &NUM orders fo &CHAR Report # &NUM to you ( or &pound; &NUM , &NUM ) . Your income in this example would be : Report # &NUM &NUM Report # &NUM &NUM Report # &NUM &NUM , &NUM Report # &NUM &NUM , &NUM Report # &NUM &NUM , &NUM Total &pound; &NUM , &NUM The numbers do n\'t lie . Get a pencil & paper or calculator and figure out the worst possible response and no matter how you calculate it , you WILL make a lot of money ! ! ! REMEMBER FRIEND , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM &NAME &CHAR MAILED TO . Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , &NUM e-mails each or more ? There are over &NUM million people on the internet worldwide and counting , with thousands more coming online every day . Believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! METHOD # &NUM : PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the &NAME is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add Method # &NUM as you go along . For every $ &NUM you receiv &CHAR , all you must do is e-mail them the Report the ordered . That \'s it . Always provide same day service on all orders . This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with YOUR name on it , will be prompt . And , they ca n\'t advertise unti &CHAR they receive the report .

THANK \'S TO THE COMPUTER &NAME AND THE INTERNET AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV : PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! Does this headline look familiar ? Of course it does . You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . And reported elsewhere in the world . His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . &NAME Bills , &NUM , &NUM and Hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . \'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM Dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . He came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive Several Thousand Dollars in &NAME Bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' &NUM get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not with magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM Bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM plus - please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! Before you say \' \' &NAME \'\' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can \' follow the simple instruction \' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \'\' . DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . This is what one had to say : \' \' Thanks to this profitable opportunity \' . I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . To my astonishment , I received a total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in \'\' . &NAME Hedland Fort &NAME , &NAME &NAME . Another said : \' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . I followed the simple instructions and &NAME . . ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in.

Email them and ask that \'s what I always &NAME the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NAME the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NAME the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NAME the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NAME YOUR name & address in the REPORT # &NUM Position .

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receives only a &NUM ( &NUM / &NUM of &NUM ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM ) . Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NAME e-mails . With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . That\'s3D100 people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people send &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM million e-mail sent out . The &NUM response is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . THAT \'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH &NUM $ &NUM , &NAME ( half a million dollars ) . Your total income in this example is : &NUM ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . ... $ &NUM , &NUM . ... Grand Total3D $ &NUM , 550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT LIE GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT , YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ( I did it was $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM months ) REMEMBER , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , &NUM e-mails each or more ? There are &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting , with thousands of more coming on line every day . Believe me , there is n\'t any better way to make money ! METHOD # &NUM : BY PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add METHOD # &NUM as you go along . For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered . That \'s it . Always provide same day service on all orders . This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . The reason for the \' cash \' is not because this is illegal or somehow \' wrong \' . It is simply about time . Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc. Concealing it is simply so no &NUM can &NAME there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY . Notes : Always send $ &NUM cash ( &NAME CURRENCY ) for each Report . Checks NOT accepted . Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least &NUM sheets of paper or foil will also work . On one of those sheets of paper , write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering , YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address .

Some nausea may occur at first because your intestines are moving again , releasing packed fecal matter that has been sitting still for some time .

Proper digestion has already been shown to cause longer life , flatter stomach , healthier skin , clearer thinking , weight loss , cleaner feeling , deeper sleep , consistent bowel movements , better organ function and more . Ultra lax causes the intestinal muscles to contract and convulse as they are meant to . If they have not been working right your whole life , you are basically working out a muscle that has been sitting atrophied over the years . In the same way you would maintain working out a particular muscle such as the leg muscle or arm muscle , you have to maintain your intestinal muscles with the right nutrients .

Please see the bottom of this message for further information and removal instructions . PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! Does this headline look familiar ? Of course it does . You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . And reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods &NAME &NAME ) . His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . Five-dollar bills , &NUM , &NUM and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . \'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had &NAME came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' I did n\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like &NUM thousand at a time in my backpack . I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] and &WEBSITE time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but I just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . \' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM - please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! Before you say \' &NAME \' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \' . DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . Note * follow the directons below , I had best results the second time when &CHAR hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . In order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . I have been extremely successful using the following company . They send out the offers , and all I do is accept money for reports , then I send back to the people as soon as possible . This is what one had to say : \' Thanks to this profitable opportunity . I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . To my astonishment , I received total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in \' . &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME . Here is another testimonial : \' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . I followed the simple instructions and walaa . . ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $ &NUM but the next &NUM months after that I made a total of $ &NUM , &NUM . So far , in the past &NUM months by re- entering the program , I have made over $ &NUM , &NUM and I am playing it again .

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , 000e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receive only a &NUM response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM . Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . That equals &NUM people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM million e-mails sent out . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . THAT \'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH3D $ &NUM , &NUM ( half million ) . Your total income in this example is : &NUM . . ... $ &NUM &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM . . . . . ... &NAME &NAME $ &NUM , &NUM NUMBERS DO NOT &NAME . GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT , YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! REMEMBER FRIEND , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , 000e-mails each or more ? There are over &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting . Believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! METHOD # &NUM : BY PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add METHOD # &NUM as you go along . For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered . That \'s it . Always provide same day service on all orders . This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . 3D3D3D3D3D3D3D3D&pound; VAILABLE REPORTS &NAME ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY . &NAME : Always send $ &NUM cash ( &NAME CURRENCY ) for each Report .

State Department Travel Advisory -- &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME is a middle-income , developing country with a strong democratic tradition . Tourist facilities are extensive and generally adequate . The capital is &NAME &NAME . English is widely spoken . Effective May &NUM , &NUM , &NAME &NAME will require that all &NAME citizens present passports valid for at least &NUM days in order to enter . &NAME traveling with both parents will be permitted to enter by presenting a &NAME birth certificate and photo identification . &NAME traveling alone or with only &NUM parent will need to present a passport . &NAME citizens are generally permitted to stay up to &NUM days . To stay legally beyond that period , travelers need to submit an application for an extension to the Office of Temporary Permits in the &NAME &NAME Department of Immigration . Tourist visas are usually not extended except under special circumstances , such as academic , employment , or medical grounds . Extension requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis . Always be prepared to present &NAME &NAME authorities proof of legal entry and stay in &NAME &NAME by their appropriately stamped passport . Under &NAME &NAME law , a photocopy of the passport and entry stamps is not sufficient to demonstrate proof of status . Americans have been detained , deported , and fined due to their failure to demonstrate legal status in &NAME &NAME . There is a departure tax for short-term visitors . Tourists who stay longer than &NUM days without receiving a formal extension can expect to pay a higher departure tax . Persons who have overstayed previous visas may be denied entry to &NAME &NAME . SAFETY AND SECURITY : On the &NAME and Pacific coasts , currents are swift and dangerous , and there are no lifeguards or signs warning of dangerous beaches . Several Americans drown each year . Adventure tourism is increasingly popular and many companies provide white-water rafting , bungee jumping , jungle canopy tours and other outdoor attractions . Since &NUM , &NUM Americans have died on flood-swollen rivers in white-water rafting accidents . Use caution in selecting adventure tourism companies . Avoid small , \' cut-rate \' companies that do not have the track record of more established companies . The government passed legislation to regulate and monitor the safety of adventure tourism companies ; enforcement is overseen by the Ministry of Health . To be granted official operating permits , registered tourism companies must meet safety standards and have insurance coverage . Demonstrations or strikes , related to labor disputes or other local issues , occur occasionally . Past demonstrations have closed ports , roadblocks , and sporadic gasoline shortages . Protests are typically non-violent . Avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place and keep informed by following the local news and consulting hotel personnel and tour guides . Crime is increasing and tourists are frequent victims . While most crimes are non-violent , criminals , including juveniles , show a greater tendency to use violence . Use the same level of caution as in major cities or tourist areas throughout the world . Avoid urban areas that are known to have high crime rates , deserted properties or undeveloped land . Walk or exercise with a companion , avoid responding to verbal harassment , and remember that resort areas popular with foreign tourists are common venues for criminal activities . Local law enforcement agencies have limited capabilities and are not up to &NAME standards , especially outside of &NAME &NAME . Several Americans have been murdered in urban , rural and resort locations . Many perpetrators have been arrested , and some convicted . Other assailants remain at large . &NAME citizens have been victims of sexual assaults in cities and rural areas . In &NUM cases , the victim knew the assailant . There have been several sexual assaults , including &NUM rape , by taxi drivers . Use licensed taxis , which are red and have medallions painted on the side . Licensed taxis at the airport are painted orange , rather than red . All taxis should have working door handles , locks , and meters ( called \'marias \' ) . Do not ride in the front seat with the driver . If the taxi meter is not working , a price should be agreed upon before the trip begins . Unsuspecting patrons of bars and nightclubs have been drugged and later assaulted or robbed . Be aware of your surroundings , and do n\'t consume food or drinks left untended . Seek entertainment in groups to help avoid being targeted . There have been several kidnappings , including those of foreigners . Carjackings have increased , and motorists confronted at gunpoint while stopped at traffic lights or upon arrival at their homes . Late model sport utility vehicles and high-end car models are popular with carjackers . Purchase an adequate theft insurance when renting vehicles . Park in secured lots whenever possible , and never leave valuables in the vehicle . Thefts from parked cars commonly occur in downtown &NAME &NAME , at beaches , in the airport , bus station parking lots , and at national parks and other tourist attractions . &CHAR common ploy involves surreptitiously puncturing the tires of rental cars , often close to the car rental agency itself .

com, 'A PROPOSITION ', '&NAME the abruptness of this letter ; it is due to its exigency . I am a government functionary in my country . I represent a locally effective caucus in dire need of your assistance . Several funds that have been on hold due to logistic problems might be returned to the Federal Government Treasury by the end of this quarter of the year following directives from the Ministry of Finance to WRITE OFF all such unclaimed foreign debt . I sincerely know what the mutual benefit we will enjoy if such funds are put in your care . As a civil servant in the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing and an ex-officio member of the Contract Review Panel , I have a particular contract sum worth millions of dollars which has been negotiated to me , that I can claim title to ( based on previous arrangements and documents at my disposal ) but has been unable to claim due to my limitations . This money can be credited to a bank account of my choice . The key issue is to solicit your collaboration in its transfer , and the subsequent investment ( if you may ) of the contract sum . I am ready to work out a compensation package payable immediately after the money is credited to your account . You must promise to re-transfer the fund into another account within &NUM working days of being credited to your account . You do not need any special expertise ; all that is required is your ability to follow the required guidelines and the will to personify the fa\' &NAME to its practical conclusion . The source of the money is legal and authoritative .

The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had &NAME came home right away and they drove together to the boys school and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' I did n\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like &NUM thousand at a time in my backpack .

Before you say \' &NAME \' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \' . DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . Note * follow the directons below , I had best results the second time when &CHAR hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . In order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . I have been extremely successful using the following company . They send out the offers , and all I do is accept money for reports , then I send back to the people as soon as possible . This is what one had to say : \' Thanks to this profitable opportunity . I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required .

He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' I did n\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like &NUM thousand at a time in my backpack . I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] &WEBSITE time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but I just rode to the next bank down the street ( &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM - please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . BE FINANCIALLY FREE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! Before you say \' &NAME \' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can follow the simple instructions , they are bound to make some megabucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \' . DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . Note * follow the directons below , I had best results the second time when &CHAR hired a bulk email service in addition to following the reports instructions . In order for all of us to be successful , many , many emails must be sent so that the returns are many . I have been extremely successful using the following company . They send out the offers , and all I do is accept money for reports , then I send back to the people as soon as possible . This is what one had to say : \' Thanks to this profitable opportunity . I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . To my astonishment , I received total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in \' . &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME . Here is another testimonial : \' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . I followed the simple instructions and walaa ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in. First month I only made $ &NUM . &NUM but the next &NUM months after that I made a total of $ &NUM , &NUM . So far , in the past &NUM months by re-entering the program , I have made over $ &NUM , &NUM and I am playing it again . The key to success in this program is to follow the simple steps and NOT change anything . \' More testimonials later but first , +++ PRINT THIS NOW FOR YOUR FUTURE REFERENCE +++ +++ Order all &NUM reports shown on the list below +++ For each report , send $ &NUM CASH , THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report . MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE &NAME LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems . +++ When you place your order , make sure you order each of the &NUM reports . You will need all &NUM reports so that you can save them on your computer . Within a few days you will receive , vie e-mail , each of the &NUM reports from these &NUM different individuals . Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the &NUM , 000\'s of people who will order them from you . Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step \' &NUM through &NUM \' or you will loose out on majority of your profits . Once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . Remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter , it will NOT work ! ! ! People have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all &NUM thinking they could get all the money . But it does not work this way . Believe us , we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed . Because if you do , it will not work for you . Remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! &NUM ... After you have ordered all &NUM reports , take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # &NUM . This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . &NUM ... Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM . &NUM ... Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM . &NUM ... Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM . &NUM ... Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # 2 &NUM ... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # &NUM Position . PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY ! * * * * Take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES . Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , 000e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receive only a &NUM response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM . Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . That equals &NUM people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM million e-mails sent out . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . THAT \'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH3D $ &NUM , &NUM ( half million ) . Your total income in this example is : &NUM . . ... $ &NUM &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM . . . . . ... &NAME &NAME $ &NUM , 550.00 NUMBERS DO NOT &NAME .

REMEMBER FRIEND , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO .

There are over &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting . Believe me , many people will do just that , and more ! METHOD # &NUM : BY PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise .

He assured me of your capability and reliability to champion a business of great magnitude like this one , although I did not tell him the nature of this business because of the confidentiality it requires . In my department , we discovered an abandoned sum of usd25million ( &NUM &NUM million United &NAME dollars only ) in a domiciliary account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died in a ghastly plane crash in January &NUM aboard &NAME airways along with his entire family . Since we got the information about his death , we have expected his next- of- kin to come over and claim the money because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines . Unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relations died along with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim . it is upon this discovery therefore , that I and &NUM key officials in my department now decided to make business with you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation of the deceased for safe-keeping and subsequent disbursement with you since nobody is coming for it and we do not want this money to be recycled into the bank \'s bounded account as an unclaimed fund . The request for a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a &NAME &NAME cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner . We have agreed that &NUM of this money will be for you as foreign partner ; thereafter my colleague and I will visit your country for the disbursement according to the agreed percentages . Personally , I would want you to advise me on the best area of investment because I am considering investing the greater proportion of my share in your country . Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of the fund via our correspondent finance house in aboard to you as arranged , you should first apply to the bank as the next of kin or business partner of the deceased indicating your account details wherein the money will be remitted . Upon receipt of your reply mail , I shall send to you the text of the application which you will be required to summit to the bank for the bank \'s procedural authentication and immediate remittance of the money to the account you are going to nominate . As soon as you receive this mail , do contact me at once through ALTERNATIVE EMAIL ; &EMAIL at once or better still you call me on my above telephone number for more clarification . And I would also like you to indicate your private and confidential telephone , fax , cellular and e-mail for the effective communication required . Be informed that all necessary arrangements towards the successful transfer of the fund via our correspondent finance house in aboard have been concluded and it is &NUM risk free .

ne.jp, 'We can all have a slice of the pie ! ', 'I recently received this e-mail and like most people was skeptical of what I read so I done some investigating on the net , because like everyone else I hate getting scammed . As I delved into the deep corridors of the vast information on the &NAME I was astonished how many times I bumped into this program . There are many many people involved with it and I had to wonder about all the money being transferred between them of which you and I would like a share . PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! Does this headline look familiar ? Of course it does . You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . And reported elsewhere in the world ( including my neck of the woods &NAME &NAME ) . His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old son \'s closet . Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . Five-dollar bills , &NUM , &NUM and hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labeled piles . \'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered , . He came home right away and they drove together to the boy \'s school and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet ? As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the top and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive several thousand dollars in five-dollar bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail . The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework . He had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' I did n\'t want the banks to get suspicious so I kept riding to different banks with like &NUM thousand at a time in my backpack . I would usually tell the lady at the bank counter that my dad had sent me in to exchange the money ] and he was outside waiting for me . &NUM time the lady gave me a really strange look and told me that she would not be able to do it for me and my dad would have to come in and do it , but I just rode to the next bank down the street ( laughs ) . \' Surprisingly , the boy did not have any reason to be afraid . The reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at all . In fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - ju3DFor each report , send $ &NUM CASH , THE NAME & NUMBER OF THE REPORT YOU ARE ORDERING and YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS to the person whose name appears ON THAT LIST next to the report . MAKE SURE YOUR RETURN ADDRESS IS ON YOUR ENVELOPE &NAME LEFT CORNER in case of any mail problems . You will need all &NUM reports so that you can save them on your computer . Within a few days you will receive , vie e-mail , each of the &NUM reports from these &NUM different individuals . Save them on your computer so they will be accessible for you to send to the &NUM , 000\'s of people who will order them from you . Also make a floppy of these reports and keep it on your desk in case something happens to your computer . IMPORTANT - DO NOT alter the names of the people who are listed next to each report , or their sequence on the list , in any way other than what is instructed below in step \' &NUM through &NUM \' or you will loose out on majority of your profits . Once you understand the way this works , you will also see how it does not work if you change it . Remember , this method has been tested , and if you alter , it will NOT work ! ! ! People have tried to put their friends / relatives names on all &NUM thinking they could get all the money . But it does not work this way . Believe us , we all have tried to be greedy and then nothing happened . So Do Not try to change anything other than what is instructed . Because if you do , it will not work for you . Remember , honesty reaps the reward ! ! ! &NUM ... After you have ordered all &NUM reports , take this advertisement and REMOVE the name & address of the person in REPORT # &NUM . This person has made it through the cycle and is no doubt counting their fortune . &NUM ... Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM . &NUM ... Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM . &NUM ... Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM . &NUM ... Move the name & address in REPORT # &NUM down TO REPORT # &NUM &NUM ... Insert YOUR name & address in the REPORT # &NUM Position . PLEASE MAKE SURE you copy every name & address ACCURATELY ! * * * * Take this entire letter , with the modified list of names , and save it on your computer . DO NOT MAKE ANY OTHER CHANGES . Save this on a disk as well just in case if you loose any data . To assist you with marketing your business on the &NAME , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , 000e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receive only a &NUM response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM . Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . That equals &NUM people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The &NUM response to that are &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM million e-mails sent out . The &NUM response to that are &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . The &NUM response to that are &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . THAT \'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH3D $ &NUM , &NUM ( half million ) . Your total income in this example is : &NUM . . ... $ &NUM &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM . . . . . ... &NAME &NAME $ &NUM , &NUM NUMBERS DO NOT &NAME . GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT , YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! REMEMBER FRIEND , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , 000e-mails each or more ? There are over &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting . Believe me ; many people will do just that , and more ! METHOD # &NUM : BY PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add METHOD # &NUM as you go along .

This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out with your name and address on it will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY . &NAME : Always send $ &NUM cash ( &NAME CURRENCY ) for each Report . Checks NOT accepted .

Imagine being able to make over a half million dollars every &NUM to &NUM months from your home . THANK \'S TO THE COMPUTER &NAME AND THE INTERNET AS SEEN ON NATIONAL TV : PARENTS OF &NUM - YEAR &NAME - FIND $ &NUM , &NUM CASH HIDDEN IN HIS CLOSET ! Does this headline look familiar ? Of course it does . You most likely have just seen this story recently featured on a major nightly news program ( &NAME ) . And reported elsewhere in the world . His mother was cleaning and putting laundry away when she came across a large brown paper bag that was suspiciously buried beneath some clothes and a skateboard in the back of her 15-year-old sons closet . Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . &NAME Bills , &NUM , &NUM and Hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . \'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM Dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . He came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive Several Thousand Dollars in &NAME Bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM Bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM plus - please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! Before you say \' \' &NAME \'\' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can \' follow the simple instruction \' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \'\' .

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receives only a &NUM ( &NUM / &NUM of &NUM ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM ) . Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . That\'s3D100 people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people send &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM million e-mail sent out . The &NUM response is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . THAT \'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH &NUM $ &NUM , &NUM ( half a million dollars ) . Your total income in this example is : &NUM ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . ... $ &NUM , &NUM ... &NAME &NAME $ &NUM , &NUM NUMBERS DO NOT &NAME GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT , YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ( I did it was $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM months ) REMEMBER , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , &NUM e-mails each or more ? There are &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting , with thousands of more coming on line every day . Believe me , there is n\'t any better way to make money ! METHOD # &NUM : BY PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add METHOD # &NUM as you go along . For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered . That \'s it . Always provide same day service on all orders . This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . The reason for the \' cash \' is not because this is illegal or somehow \' wrong \' . It is simply about time . Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc. Concealing it is simply so no &NUM can &NAME there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY . &NAME : Always send $ &NUM cash ( &NAME CURRENCY ) for each Report . Checks NOT accepted . Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least &NUM sheets of paper or foil will also work . On one of those sheets of paper , write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering , YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address .

If you did not , continue advertising or sending e-mails until you do . * * Once you have received &NUM or more orders for Report# &NUM , YOU CAN RELAX , because the system is already working for you , and the cash will continue to roll in ! THIS IS IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER : Every time your name is moved down on the list , you are placed in front of a Different report . You can KEEP TRACK of your PROGRESS by watching which report people are ordering from you . IF YOU WANT TO GENERATE MORE INCOME SEND ANOTHER BATCH OF E-MAILS AND START THE WHOLE PROCESS AGAIN .

Germs are spread easily and many sufferers find themselves on planes rather than in bed . &CHAR good percentage of these travelers experience barotrauma on take-offs and landings . &NAME is ear pain from a blocked eustachian tube ( the middle ear \'s pressure-equalizing valve ) . Some people have it on all flights ; others only when afflicted with hay fever , allergies , a cold or sinus infection . Infants and children are particularly vulnerable . According to Dr. &NAME &NAME &NAME , of the Ear Institute in &NAME &NAME and surgeon &NAME &NAME of the &NAME &NAME , this painful condition can be avoided . Here are some trip tips to get you through a flight . All of the remedies restore the pressure equalizing function of the eustachian tube which normally opens for a fraction of a second about once every &NUM minutes in response to swallowing or yawning . &NUM &NAME &NAME , suck candy or yawn vigorously on take-off and landing , to equalize pressure in the middle ear . &NUM Stay awake for ascents and descents because we swallow less when asleep . &NAME up sleeping children and infants as well . &NUM &NAME a pacifier or bottle in an infant \'s mouth to encourage swallowing . &NUM Drink water . Avoid coffee and alcohol . &NUM Take nasal spray shortly before boarding the aircraft . Use it &NUM minutes before landing and again every &NUM minutes for &NUM minutes . &NUM If your ears plug up during ascent , hold your nose and swallow . This helps suck excess air pressure out of the middle ear . &NUM On descent , try the &NAME maneuver ; hold your nose and blow forcibly to get air up the eustachian tube into the middle ear . Do not do this if you have an upper respiratory infection . Persistent ear pain after landing could signify an infection that should be treated by a doctor . Doctors &NAME Airport Food -- Before you pack your bags , you may want to consult the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine \'s ( &NAME \'s) new review of airport food at the busiest &NAME airports . The Airport &NAME Rating Survey is available at &WEBSITE The physicians \' group evaluated airport restaurants based on which served the most low-fat , high-fiber , cholesterol-free meals . For the second year in a row , &NAME &NAME International Airport landed the highest marks with &NUM percent of all its restaurants offering a healthy option . &NAME took a nosedive from last year \'s number &NUM ranking to finish at number &NUM . \' Because of national security issues , people are spending more of their time waiting around in airports than ever before . And although more people may need to eat before or between flights , healthy meals can be hard to find in more than half of the airports we surveyed , \' says &NAME dietitian , &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME The survey found the average percentage of healthy options remained about the same , with some airports improving and others dropping by as many as &NUM percentage points . A restaurant was rated \' healthy \' if it offered at least &NUM low-fat , high-fiber , cholesterol-free entree . To get the percentage score , &NAME divided the number of \' healthy restaurants \' by the total number of restaurants . \' While a number of restaurants made healthy additions to their menu , the most dramatic addition was &NAME &NAME \'s &NAME &NAME , a veggie burger which debuted last May . Some airports have as many as &NUM &NAME &NAME restaurants , making it much easier to find a low-fat , vegetarian option , even where you \'d least expect it , \' says &NAME &NAME .

Go to &WEBSITE Sailing at a Snail \'s &NAME by &NAME &NAME A barge cruise is a different breed of cruise . It \'s a &NUM degree departure from what most people think of when you mention cruising . The biggest difference is size . Barge cruises are intimate affairs . Where a cruise ship can have a passenger list that numbers in the hundreds or thousands , a barge that cruises on a canal usually has fewer than &NUM passengers . The &NAME , which sailed in the heart of &NAME &NAME , from &NAME to &NAME , can carry up to &NUM passengers , but there were only &NUM passengers on our trip . For &NUM days , the &NAME was our floating hotel , the place where we ate , slept , relaxed and socialized , served by a French crew and chef , British hotel manager and Australian tour guide . There is no gambling , bingo , dance classes or other distractions as the large cruise ships offer . Evening entertainment on the &NAME usually depends on how much the passengers want to interact . The cruise line does schedule &NUM evening of entertainment mid-week in the cruise . &CHAR local musician presided over an evening of festivities . A one-man band , he sang French standards ( in English ) while playing a keyboard . After the obligatory French songs , the rest of the evening he belted out an array of American rock classics . Our floating hotel provided us with all meals during the cruise , prepared by our onboard master chef &NAME . The service was as elegant as the food , with linen-clad table tops decked out in cleverly folded linen napkins , with a different design for each meal . Breakfast , the most casual of the meals , is buffet-style on a table topped with warm croissants and breads , fruits , cheeses and even cold cereals to cater to American tastes . Wine is served with lunch and dinner , paired to each course , and a fully stocked bar compliments cocktail hour . A barge cruise has no litany of cruise ports . Instead , you choose a barge by the region it sails in. For instance in &NAME , you can choose &NAME , &NAME , &NAME or &NAME . Barge cruises are also available in &NAME , &NAME , &NAME and &NAME . Excursions are included and built into the &NAME \'s itinerary . Unlike a conventional cruise ship where passengers pour out at each port and may overwhelm that port , we trickled from the &NAME . We easily blended into the pace of life at small villages and were able to meet and talk to the local people . There \'s no need for motion-sickness remedies as the &NAME floats along on calm canal waters . During the six-day journey , the barge passed through 40-some locks . Each lock is overseen by a local lock keeper and manually operated . Lock keepers are assigned several locks . Like a throw-back to life in the early &NUM , when their duty is finished at &NUM lock , they hop on their bicycles and speed to the next lock , always reaching it well ahead of the barge . Rustic little stone lock houses , many with lace curtains and pots overflowing with colorful flowers , add a nostalgic flavor to the fairy-tale like scenery and stand sentinel at each lock . Another major difference is speed . The &NAME offers a relaxed pace . You float along a nearly still canal at about &NUM miles an hour , or as the cruise line literature says at a \'snail \'s pace . \' Every few kilometers , the barge stops to transit a canal lock . While the barge sits in the lock rising or lowering to the next plateau , passengers can get on and off the barge . Bicycles are on board each barge so passengers can ride along the path that parallels the canal . The &NAME travels so slow that you can ride a bike , walk at your own speed or explore the surroundings and easily meet up with the barge . &NAME , one of the passengers who loved to walk for his daily exercise , would power ahead on the path and wait for the &NAME to arrive several locks down . While &NAME went full-steam-ahead , other passenger simply sat on the &NAME \'s outside deck and watched the countryside drift by . This freedom lets you be as active or inactive as you choose . Excursions do n\'t compete with sailing . Each day featured a trip by bus to a nearby town . Passengers return from excursions for lunch . As soon as the lunch dishes are cleared , the &NAME starts to sails along the canal headed toward that evening \'s mooring . The &NUM optional trip many of the passengers took was a hot air balloon ride over the vineyards and valleys of &NAME . Our first day \'s excursion took us on a tour of the 12th century chateau at &NAME , which is privately owned and still lived in , and the Medieval hilltop village of &NAME en &NAME . Wander the village \'s well-worn cobblestones streets and you \'ll find several small cafes , a couple of antique shops and a gift shop or &NUM , frequented more by villagers than tourists . &NAME en &NAME is not about buying T-shirts or visiting a &NAME \'s. The village is about atmosphere , a glimpse at life in the past , where you can admire the ancient architecture , pet the plethora of cats sitting in ancient leaded windows or watch children and their mothers go about their daily routines . From the hilltop vantage point at the edge of the tiny village , &NAME our guide , pointed out landmarks in this sweeping panorama , including the &NAME docked at &NAME , our arrival point . Other days trips included a visit to a winery for a wine tasting , market day in &NAME and &NAME , the center of the wine trade in &NAME . Each trip allowed time for shopping or exploring on your own .

I \'ll be happy to try to help you , but I \'ve got to help these folks first , and I \'m sure we \'ll be able to work something out . \' The passenger was unimpressed . He asked loudly , so that the passengers behind him could hear , \'Do you have any idea who I am ? \' Without hesitating , the gate agent smiled and grabbed her public address microphone . \'May I have your attention please \' she began . \' We have a passenger here at the gate WHO DOES NOT KNOW WHO HE IS . If anyone can help him find his identity , please come to the gate . \' With the folks behind him in line laughing hysterically , the man glared at the United agent , gritted his teeth and swore , &CHAR * * * you ! \' Without flinching , she smiled and said , \' I \'m sorry sir , but you \'ll have to stand in line for that , too . \' She wants JEWELRY for Valentine\' \'s &NAME -- &NAME &NAME Outlet\' \'s &NAME \'s special are beautiful sterling silver hearts that will surely win her heart .

Germs are spread easily and many sufferers find themselves on planes rather than in bed . &CHAR good percentage of these travelers experience barotrauma on take-offs and landings . &NAME is ear pain from a blocked eustachian tube ( the middle ear \'s pressure-equalizing valve ) . Some people have it on all flights ; others only when afflicted with hay fever , allergies , a cold or sinus infection . Infants and children are particularly vulnerable . According to Dr. &NAME &NAME &NAME , of the Ear Institute in &NAME &NAME and surgeon &NAME &NAME of the &NAME &NAME , this painful condition can be avoided . Here are some trip tips to get you through a flight . All of the remedies restore the pressure equalizing function of the eustachian tube which normally opens for a fraction of a second about once every &NUM minutes in response to swallowing or yawning . &NUM &NAME &NAME , suck candy or yawn vigorously on take-off and landing , to equalize pressure in the middle ear . &NUM Stay awake for ascents and descents because we swallow less when asleep . &NAME up sleeping children and infants as well . &NUM &NAME a pacifier or bottle in an infant \'s mouth to encourage swallowing . &NUM Drink water . Avoid coffee and alcohol . &NUM Take nasal spray shortly before boarding the aircraft . Use it &NUM minutes before landing and again every &NUM minutes for &NUM minutes . &NUM If your ears plug up during ascent , hold your nose and swallow . This helps suck excess air pressure out of the middle ear . &NUM On descent , try the &NAME maneuver ; hold your nose and blow forcibly to get air up the eustachian tube into the middle ear . Do not do this if you have an upper respiratory infection . Persistent ear pain after landing could signify an infection that should be treated by a doctor . Doctors &NAME Airport Food -- Before you pack your bags , you may want to consult the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine \'s ( &NAME \'s) new review of airport food at the busiest &NAME airports . The Airport &NAME Rating Survey is available at &WEBSITE The physicians \' group evaluated airport restaurants based on which served the most low-fat , high-fiber , cholesterol-free meals . For the second year in a row , &NAME &NAME International Airport landed the highest marks with &NUM percent of all its restaurants offering a healthy option . &NAME took a nosedive from last year \'s number &NUM ranking to finish at number &NUM . \' Because of national security issues , people are spending more of their time waiting around in airports than ever before . And although more people may need to eat before or between flights , healthy meals can be hard to find in more than half of the airports we surveyed , \' says &NAME dietitian , &NAME &NAME , &NAME , &NAME The survey found the average percentage of healthy options remained about the same , with some airports improving and others dropping by as many as &NUM percentage points . A restaurant was rated \' healthy \' if it offered at least &NUM low-fat , high-fiber , cholesterol-free entree . To get the percentage score , &NAME divided the number of \' healthy restaurants \' by the total number of restaurants . \' While a number of restaurants made healthy additions to their menu , the most dramatic addition was &NAME &NAME \'s &NAME &NAME , a veggie burger which debuted last May . Some airports have as many as &NUM &NAME &NAME restaurants , making it much easier to find a low-fat , vegetarian option , even where you \'d least expect it , \' says &NAME &NAME . Here are the scores for the &NUM busy airports plus the number of healthy restaurants and total restaurants .

Go to &WEBSITE Sailing at a Snail \'s &NAME by &NAME &NAME A barge cruise is a different breed of cruise . It \'s a &NUM degree departure from what most people think of when you mention cruising . The biggest difference is size . Barge cruises are intimate affairs . Where a cruise ship can have a passenger list that numbers in the hundreds or thousands , a barge that cruises on a canal usually has fewer than &NUM passengers . The &NAME , which sailed in the heart of &NAME &NAME , from &NAME to &NAME , can carry up to &NUM passengers , but there were only &NUM passengers on our trip . For &NUM days , the &NAME was our floating hotel , the place where we ate , slept , relaxed and socialized , served by a French crew and chef , British hotel manager and Australian tour guide . There is no gambling , bingo , dance classes or other distractions as the large cruise ships offer . Evening entertainment on the &NAME usually depends on how much the passengers want to interact . The cruise line does schedule &NUM evening of entertainment mid-week in the cruise . &CHAR local musician presided over an evening of festivities . A one-man band , he sang French standards ( in English ) while playing a keyboard . After the obligatory French songs , the rest of the evening he belted out an array of American rock classics . Our floating hotel provided us with all meals during the cruise , prepared by our onboard master chef &NAME . The service was as elegant as the food , with linen-clad table tops decked out in cleverly folded linen napkins , with a different design for each meal . Breakfast , the most casual of the meals , is buffet-style on a table topped with warm croissants and breads , fruits , cheeses and even cold cereals to cater to American tastes . Wine is served with lunch and dinner , paired to each course , and a fully stocked bar compliments cocktail hour . A barge cruise has no litany of cruise ports . Instead , you choose a barge by the region it sails in. For instance in &NAME , you can choose &NAME , &NAME , &NAME or &NAME . Barge cruises are also available in &NAME , &NAME , &NAME and &NAME . Excursions are included and built into the &NAME \'s itinerary . Unlike a conventional cruise ship where passengers pour out at each port and may overwhelm that port , we trickled from the &NAME . We easily blended into the pace of life at small villages and were able to meet and talk to the local people . There \'s no need for motion-sickness remedies as the &NAME floats along on calm canal waters . During the six-day journey , the barge passed through 40-some locks . Each lock is overseen by a local lock keeper and manually operated . Lock keepers are assigned several locks . Like a throw-back to life in the early &NUM , when their duty is finished at &NUM lock , they hop on their bicycles and speed to the next lock , always reaching it well ahead of the barge . Rustic little stone lock houses , many with lace curtains and pots overflowing with colorful flowers , add a nostalgic flavor to the fairy-tale like scenery and stand sentinel at each lock . Another major difference is speed . The &NAME offers a relaxed pace . You float along a nearly still canal at about &NUM miles an hour , or as the cruise line literature says at a \'snail \'s pace . \' Every few kilometers , the barge stops to transit a canal lock . While the barge sits in the lock rising or lowering to the next plateau , passengers can get on and off the barge . Bicycles are on board each barge so passengers can ride along the path that parallels the canal . The &NAME travels so slow that you can ride a bike , walk at your own speed or explore the surroundings and easily meet up with the barge . &NAME , one of the passengers who loved to walk for his daily exercise , would power ahead on the path and wait for the &NAME to arrive several locks down . While &NAME went full-steam-ahead , other passenger simply sat on the &NAME \'s outside deck and watched the countryside drift by . This freedom lets you be as active or inactive as you choose . Excursions do n\'t compete with sailing . Each day featured a trip by bus to a nearby town . Passengers return from excursions for lunch . As soon as the lunch dishes are cleared , the &NAME starts to sails along the canal headed toward that evening \'s mooring . The &NUM optional trip many of the passengers took was a hot air balloon ride over the vineyards and valleys of &NAME . Our first day \'s excursion took us on a tour of the 12th century chateau at &NAME , which is privately owned and still lived in , and the Medieval hilltop village of &NAME en &NAME . Wander the village \'s well-worn cobblestones streets and you \'ll find several small cafes , a couple of antique shops and a gift shop or &NUM , frequented more by villagers than tourists . &NAME en &NAME is not about buying T-shirts or visiting a &NAME \'s. The village is about atmosphere , a glimpse at life in the past , where you can admire the ancient architecture , pet the plethora of cats sitting in ancient leaded windows or watch children and their mothers go about their daily routines . From the hilltop vantage point at the edge of the tiny village , &NAME our guide , pointed out landmarks in this sweeping panorama , including the &NAME docked at &NAME , our arrival point . Other days trips included a visit to a winery for a wine tasting , market day in &NAME and &NAME , the center of the wine trade in &NAME . Each trip allowed time for shopping or exploring on your own .

Nothing could have prepared her for the shock she got when she opened the bag and found it was full of cash . &NAME Bills , &NUM , &NUM and Hundreds - all neatly rubber-banded in labelled piles . \'My first thought was that he had robbed a bank \' , says the 41-year-old woman , \' There was over $ &NUM , &NUM Dollars in that bag -- that \'s more than my husband earns in a year \' . The woman immediately called her husband at the car-dealership where he worked to tell him what she had discovered . He came home right away , and they drove together to the boys school , and picked him up . Little did they suspect that where the money came from , was more shocking than actually finding it in the closet . As it turns out , the boy had been sending out , via E-mail , a type of \' Report \' to E-mail addresses that he obtained off the &NAME . Everyday after school for the past &NUM months , he had been doing this right on his computer in his bedroom . \' I just got the E-mail &NUM day and I figured what the heck , I put my name on it like the instructions said and I started sending it out \' , says the clever 15-year-old . The E-mail letter listed &NUM addresses and contained instructions to send &NUM $ &NUM dollar bill to each person on the list , then delete the address at the bottom and move the others addresses Down , and finally to add your name to the top of the list . The letter goes on to state that you would receive Several Thousand Dollars in &NAME Bills within &NUM weeks if you sent out the letter with your name at the top of the 5-address list . \' I get junk E-mail all the time , and really did not think it was going to work \' , the boy continues . Within the first few days of sending out the E-mail , the &NAME Office &NAME that his parents had gotten him for his video-game magazine subscriptions began to fill up with not with magazines , but envelopes containing $ &NUM Bills . \' About a week later I rode [ my bike ] down to the post office and my box had &NUM magazine and about &NUM envelops stuffed in it . There was also a yellow slip that said I had to go up to the [ post office ] counter . I thought I was in trouble or something ( laughs ) \' . He goes on , \' I went up to the counter and they had a whole box of more mail for me . I had to ride back home and empty out my backpack because I could not carry it all \' . Over the next few weeks , the boy continued sending out the E-mail .\' The money just kept coming in and I just kept sorting it and stashing it in the closet , barely had time for my homework \' &NAME had also been riding his bike to several of the banks in his area and exchanging the $ &NUM bills for &NUM , &NUM and hundreds . \' &WEBSITE reporting news team examined and investigated the so-called \' chain-letter \' the boy was sending out and found that it was not a chain-letter at &NAME fact , it was completely legal according to &NAME &NAME and &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NUM , Section &NUM and &NUM , or Title &NUM , Section &NUM in the US code , also in the code of federal regulations , &NAME &NUM , Sections &NUM and &NUM , which state a product or service must be exchanged for money received . Every five-dollar bill that he received contained a little note that read , \' Please send me report number &NAME \' .This simple note made the letter legal because he was exchanging a service ( &CHAR Report on how-to ) for a five-dollar fee . [ This is the end of the media release . If you would like to understand how the system works and get your $ &NUM , &NUM plus - please continue reading . What appears below is what the &NUM year old was sending out on the net - YOU CAN &NAME IT TOO - just follow the simple instructions ] . BE AN INTERNET MILLIONAIRE LIKE OTHERS WITHIN A YEAR ! ! ! Before you say \' \' &NAME \'\' , please read the following . This is the letter you have been hearing about on the news lately . Due to the popularity of this letter on the &NAME , a national weekly news program recently devoted an entire show to the investigation of this program described below , to see if it really can make people money . The show also investigated whether or not the program was legal . Their findings proved once and for all that there are \' \' absolutely NO Laws prohibiting the participation in the program and if people can \' follow the simple instruction \' they are bound to make some mega bucks with only $ &NUM out of pocket cost \'\' . DUE TO THE RECENT INCREASE OF POPULARITY & RESPECT THIS PROGRAM HAS ATTAINED , IT IS CURRENTLY WORKING BETTER THAN EVER . This is what one had to say : \' \' Thanks to this profitable opportunity \' . I was approached many times before but each time I passed on it . I am so glad I finally joined just to see what one could expect in return for the minimal effort and money required . To my astonishment , I received a total $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM weeks , with money still coming in \'\' . &NAME &NAME &NAME &NAME , &NAME &NAME . Another said : \' This program has been around for a long time but I never believed in it . But &NUM day when I received this again in the mail I decided to gamble my $ &NUM on it . I followed the simple instructions and &NAME . . ... &NUM weeks later the money started to come in.

To assist you with marketing your business on the internet , the &NUM reports you purchase will provide you with invaluable marketing information which includes how to send bulk e-mails legally , where to find thousands of free classified ads and much more . There are &NUM Primary methods to get this venture going : METHOD # &NUM : BY SENDING BULK E-MAIL LEGALLY Let \'s say that you decide to start small , just to see how it goes , and we will assume You and those involved send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails each . Let \'s also assume that the mailing receives only a &NUM ( &NUM / &NUM of &NUM ) response ( the response could be much better but lets just say it is only &NUM ) . Also many people will send out hundreds of thousands e-mails instead of only &NUM , &NUM each ) . Continuing with this example , you send out only &NUM , &NUM e-mails . With a &NUM response , that is only &NUM orders for report # &NUM . Those &NUM people responded by sending out &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM , &NUM . Out of those &NUM , &NUM e-mails only &NUM responded with orders . That\'s3D100 people responded and ordered Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people mail out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM people send &NUM , &NUM e-mail each for a total of &NUM million e-mail sent out . The &NUM response is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . Those &NUM , &NUM people send out &NUM , &NUM e-mails each for a total of &NUM , &NUM , &NUM ( &NUM million ) e-mails . The &NUM response to that is &NUM , &NUM orders for Report # &NUM . THAT \'S &NUM , &NUM ORDERS TIMES $ &NUM EACH &NUM $ &NUM , &NUM ( half a million dollars ) . Your total income in this example is : &NUM ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . . ... $ &NUM , &NUM + &NUM . ... $ &NUM , &NUM ... &NAME &NAME $ &NUM , &NUM NUMBERS DO NOT &NAME GET A PENCIL & PAPER AND FIGURE OUT THE WORST POSSIBLE RESPONSES AND NO MATTER HOW YOU CALCULATE IT , YOU WILL STILL MAKE A LOT OF MONEY ! ( I did it was $ &NUM , &NUM in &NUM months ) REMEMBER , THIS IS ASSUMING ONLY &NUM PEOPLE ORDERING OUT OF &NUM , &NUM YOU MAILED TO . Dare to think for a moment what would happen if everyone or half or even &NUM 4th of those people mailed &NUM , &NUM e-mails each or more ? There are &NUM million people on the &NAME worldwide and counting , with thousands of more coming on line every day . Believe me , there is n\'t any better way to make money ! METHOD # &NUM : BY PLACING FREE &NAME ON THE INTERNET Advertising on the net is very , very inexpensive and there are hundreds of FREE places to advertise . Placing a lot of free ads on the &NAME will easily get a larger response . We strongly suggest you start with Method # &NUM and add METHOD # &NUM as you go along . For every $ &NUM you receive , all you must do is e-mail them the Report they ordered . That \'s it . Always provide same day service on all orders . This will guarantee that the e-mail they send out , with your name and address on it , will be prompt because they can not advertise until they receive the report . The reason for the \' cash \' is not because this is illegal or somehow \' wrong \' . It is simply about time . Time for checks or credit cards to be cleared or approved , etc. Concealing it is simply so no &NUM can &NAME there is money in the envelope and steal it before it gets to you . ORDER EACH REPORT BY ITS NUMBER & NAME ONLY . &NAME : Always send $ &NUM cash ( &NAME CURRENCY ) for each Report . Checks NOT accepted . Make sure the cash is concealed by wrapping it in at least &NUM sheets of paper or foil will also work . On one of those sheets of paper , write the NUMBER & the NAME of the Report you are ordering , YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS and your name and postal address .
